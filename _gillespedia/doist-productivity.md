# Eat the Frog

*Author: Becky Kane*

Start each day by doing the biggest, hardest thing on your plate before doing anything else.

## Why

Eating the frog ensures you‚Äôre putting first things first and giving them your best. It puts you in control of consistently progressing toward what‚Äôs important to you.

## How to

1. Identify the Frog üê∏

    What‚Äôs your most important (often, also your hardest) **one** thing to do today?

    Decide tomorrow‚Äôs Most Important Task (MIT) at the end of the day. Set up your work environment to begin work on it immediately in the morning.

2. Eat it üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥

    Do that team first. Don‚Äôt give anything else a chance to get in your way. Take an hour. Take 4. If you need more than half your day, break down the task into sections and complete a section.

3. Do it again tomorrow. üîÅ

## Themes

Deep work. Focusing on what‚Äôs important & ensuring you take at least one step toward it every day. Being proactive, not reactive.

Apparently Gina Trapani eats frogs. Neat.

# Commitment Inventory

*Author: Jackie Ashton*

Organize your life into categories, assign each a weight, organize to-dos and time-blocks around those categories according to their weights.

## Why

Doing a commitment inventory serves to align the energy you spend with the relative importance of the task to you. It prevents you from spacing out on areas of your life, or falling too deeply into a rabbit hole.

## How to

1. List everything you spend your time on
2. Group that list into logical categories
3. Assign each category a percentage of your life you want to spend doing it
4. Ensure each category has enough time to do it well

    If you‚Äôre spending 5% of your time in a lot of areas, you‚Äôre not really focusing on any of them

5. Organize your to-dos around your categories

    If you can‚Äôt really fit a ‚Äúto-do‚Äù that‚Äôs come across your plate into a category, ask yourself if you really should do it at all

6. Break down big tasks into small checklists
7. Work in bursts, aligned with your categories

    Do pomodoro-style work bursts, themed around a given Category

## Themes

This productivity method is focused on alignment of action with value. It‚Äôs one of several that serve to force you to question why you‚Äôre doing the things you‚Äôre doing. It attempts to boil down life into manageable categories, then break down the things you want to get done into those categories, and break down further still to the actual actions needed to do them.

# Medium Method

*Author: Chad Hall*

Use physical pen & paper throughout the day. Process & transcribe to digital repositories during a nightly review.

## Why

Some people work best with pen and paper. Almost everyone could benefit from using it more.

## How to

This felt more appropriate...

## Themes

Nightly review. Selectively transcribing what‚Äôs important through desired difficulty.

# The Pomodoro Technique

*Author: Laura Scroggs* 

Work in Sprints, with breaks between them. 

## Why

The Pomodoro Technique reduces distraction & ensures we‚Äôre not working past the point of diminishing returns. Also it promotes a healthy balance of work and life.

## How To

1. Pick a task on your to-do list
2. Set a timer for ~25 minutes (this is one ‚ÄúPomodoro‚Äù)
3. Work ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY on that task during those 25 minutes
4. Take a 5 minute break (also timed)
5. GoTo 1. Repeat.
6. Every ~4th Pomodoro, take a longer break (~20/30 minutes)

This technique also encourages thinking of your tasks in terms of the ‚ÄúPomodoro‚Äú duration necessary to accomplish them. It also has you schedule your day around Pomodoros. It‚Äôs very all-in.

## Themes

Focus on deep work. Not spending more time on tasks than they actually require. Planning & executing the plan.

# Eisenhower Matrix

*Author: Laura Scroggs*

Know the difference between urgent, and important. Do all important things. Delegate or delete the unimportant things.

## Why

Because long-term success means more than just focusing on the urgent, and that‚Äôs what people tend to do by default.

## How to

1. Ask yourself ‚Äúwhat on my to-do list is urgent?‚Äù
2. Ask yourself ‚Äúwhat on my to-do list is important?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat SHOULD be on my to-do list, but isn‚Äôt?‚Äù
3. Anything that‚Äôs on both lists, do now.
4. Anything that‚Äôs only important, schedule it & make sure you follow through on.
5. Anything that‚Äôs not important, but is urgent, find someone else to do it.
6. Anything that‚Äôs not important or urgent, don‚Äôt do it.

## Themes

Thinking about what you‚Äôre working on. Aligning your efforts with what promotes long-term success.

# Systemist

*Author: Amir Salihefedic*

6 Basic Principles to being productive. 

## Why

I think this was included because Amir Salhefedic is a founder and CEO of Todoist. It‚Äôs fine, just reads more like a set of guidelines than a true ‚Äúsystem‚Äù - which is ironic given its name. This is a bit more of an advert for Todoist than the others.

## How to

1. Take it everywhere
2. Capture everything

    (tasks, ideas, shopping list items, emails to write, websites to check, recurring reviews, etc)

3. Break it up into small, actionable tasks
4. Prioritize
5. Get to to-do list zero daily
6. Get consistent feedback

## Themes

Use Todoist... and the same basic productivity advice as anything else. Not bad, just not interesting.

# Weekly Review

*Author: Fadeke Adegbuyi*

A once-a-week review of your systems that bridges your long-term ambitions to your day-to-day activities & ensures you don‚Äôt leave anything important unattended.

## Why

The Weekly Review enables any other productivity habit, goal, or framework you want to use. The weekly review is a time or planning and reflection. It is a time to get your affairs in order and align yourself with your work. It serves as a backbone around which you can build other routines, ensuring that things won‚Äôt fall through the crack, without forcing you to constantly be thinking about everything.

## How to

1. Develop a routine utilizing your systems
    1. Declutter your space and your head

        What‚Äôs bothering you? Clean your desk & digital workspaces.

    2. Reflect on the week

        What didn‚Äôt get done? What went well?

    3. Get current on goals & projects

        Inbox Zero. How are the Projects going?

    4. Plan the week ahead

        What tasks do I need to make? What themes should my days have?

    5. Think bigger

        How can I do better next week?

2. Follow the routine each week

## Themes

Integration. Planning. Goal-setting. Alignment. The Weekly Review is the backbone of everything else.

# OKRs

*Author: Becky Kane*

The big hairy audacious goals we set and the concrete, measurable steps we take to get there. 

## Why

The OKR technique is simple, but effective. It forces you to choose your long-term priorities, these priorities give you a clear purpose. You pair those big goals with concrete, measurable milestones to make progress against. They are especially effective in large organizations at achieving large goals.

## How To

Aaron‚Äôs note: this article in the blog is subpar in terms of explaining ‚Äúhow‚Äù, especially when you‚Äôre not setting them for a team.

1. A few times a year, sit down and decide what you want to be in the future.
2. Pick 3 to 5 big ‚ÄúObjectives‚Äù that would ‚Äúmake you‚Äù that person.
3. Break down each of those 3 to 5 goals into concrete ‚ÄúKey Results‚Äù
    1. They should be well-defined and measurable
    2. They should encompass the Objective such that, if you achieve the Key Results then you have necessarily also achieved your Objective
4. Check in on the Objectives and Key Results periodically to guide your resource use.

## Themes

Clarity. Alignment. Period reviews separated by focused sessions of activity.

# GTD

*Author: Laura Scruggs*

Make lists. Break down ideas and projects into small actions. Make time to check your systems and set yourself up for success.

## Why

Getting Things Done is a cornerstone of general productivity. It is a set of behaviors that synergize with one another to create a robust framework for knocking out projects and not missing appointments without driving yourself crazy in the process. 

## How To

1. Capture ideas, tasks, arms anything else important. Use a consistent place (or a few consistent places) to write it all down.
2. Clarify what you‚Äôve written down into things you can do. Break down big Tasks into little ones. 
3. Organize everything. Check your various lists and make a plan to make your life easier in the future when you work on them. Dope things away where they are useful.
4. Review everything on a consistent and recurring basis.
5. Engage with the work you‚Äôve set out to do with a sense of calm and ease, because you know you‚Äôre on top of everything and you‚Äôve clarified what you want into steps you can take to get it.

## Themes

Getting things done is all about getting things out of your head so you can focus on the task at hand, and making time and space to get yourself urbanized.

# Time Blocking

*Author: Laura Scruggs*

Build dedicated blocks of working time into your schedule, during that time work on what you had scheduled. 

## Why

Time Blocking gets you out of a mode of being constantly reactive. Blocked time is more efficient than constantly multitasking. It builds in time to actually get traction and make progress on the work you want to be doing without getting pulled away by something else. Also it ensures you are spending your resources on the RIGHT things, rather than the loudest ones. Lastly, it encourages a dedicated focus to the task at hand, free from distractions. This allows you to get traction, instead of distraction.

## How To

Time blocking comes in a few different forms, all of which break down to this general scheme:

1. Decide what needs to be done
2. Decide when you‚Äôre going to do it
3. Schedule that time to do the thing
4. During that time, do the thing

### Variants

- **Time Blocking** - standard. Set aside a time to do a specific task. Do the task during that time.
- **Task Batching** - this is a related technique. Don‚Äôt distribute little tasks throughout the day. Do all tasks of the same kind at once. Minimize context switching. Example of this would be to process your inbox all at once near the end of the day, rather than attend to emails throughout the day.
- **Day Theming** - a less specific variant of time blocking. Rather than setting out a dedicated chunk of time to do a dedicated thing, you decide a ‚Äútype‚Äù of work that you will focus on for a whole day (while still attending to your normal daily tasks)
- **Time Boxing** - a MORE specific variant of Time Blocking, rather than saying ‚ÄúI will take this time to do this task‚Äù, you say ‚ÄúI will take ONLY this time to do this task‚Äù. You impose a deadline. You don‚Äôt let the task take longer than is needed.

## Themes

Intentionality. Mono tasking. Control.
