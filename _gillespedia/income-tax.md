# Federal & State Income Tax

Everyone in the United States is subject to the Federal Income Tax. Most states also have their own version of income tax that you pay on top of the Federal Income Tax.

They all follow the same basic model.

- Our government needs money for roads, schools, the military, etc.
- Part of the way we give it money is as a percentage of income.
- All the money you make in a given year is your <span style="color: #20C6EE">gross income</span>.
- We decided some of the money you make shouldn't count toward you gross income. These <span style="color: #8D0D0D">deductions</span> are for things society values. Such as...
   - Donations to charity
   - Health insurance expenses
   - Expenses looking for a job
   - Paying other taxes
- Your <span style="color: #20C6EE">gross income</span> minus your <span style="color: #8D0D0D">deductions</span> is your <span style="color: #ECB927">taxable income</span>.
- Your <span style="color: #F60E0E">taxes</span> are where your <span style="color: #ECB927">taxable income</span> means the <span style="color: #D4F327">T</span><span style="color: #ACF327">AX R</span><span style="color: #80D32E">ATE</span> <span style="color: #4C8612">LIN</span><span style="color: #C954DA">E</span>.
- The <span style="color: #D4F327">T</span><span style="color: #ACF327">AX R</span><span style="color: #80D32E">ATE</span> <span style="color: #4C8612">LIN</span><span style="color: #C954DA">E</span> is piecewise linear, broken into "tax brackets" with different slopes (tax rates).
- Law makers decide...
   - Where the tax brackets begin and end
   - What is the slope of the <span style="color: #D4F327">T</span><span style="color: #ACF327">AX R</span><span style="color: #80D32E">ATE</span> <span style="color: #4C8612">LIN</span><span style="color: #C954DA">E</span> in each bracket
   - What kinds of expenses are <span style="color: #8D0D0D">deductible</span>
- Rather than pay our <span style="color: #F60E0E">income tax</span> all at once, we guess what it will be for the whole year, then pay it a little bit at a time each paycheck.
- Once a year (before a deadline usually set mid-April), we check our guess, then a check is cut (either by you or the government) to correct for errors in the guess. This correction is called your "refund".

Now, in actuality, there is **way more details** that go into all of this. There's an entire industry of people whose full time jobs are to work out how this should be done and how to best help people do it. This, though, is a pretty decent cutoff point to claim basic understanding. Congratulations.
