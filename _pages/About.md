I'm Aaron Gillespie. I'm the guy in that picture down there (in blue, not in orange). This website is my internet-facing presence. I maintain it for fun and to keep myself producing creative content. I'm a married father of two. I am an Electrical Engineer by education, but have spent more energy learning to code since my graduation from college. I'm an advocate of self-tracking, knowing what's important to you, and getting things done.

# <a href="https://aarongilly.com/tags/">The Column</a>
The Column has existed in one form or another for most of the past two decades, from a "The Column" section of the Xanga page for a band the author was in for 3 weeks in middle school, to a WordPress page hosted by a friend, to a Tumblr right after college, to a Blogger blog for the past 7 years, and now on GitHub Pages. Its purpose is solely for its author's entertainment. If you enjoy any portion of reading it, that's a happy side effect.
Columns cover whatever topic I feel like writing about at the time. As such, their content is usually contemporaneous to the time and always informal.
## Typical Topics
- consumer technology
- quantified self stuff
- musings on life
- movies, mostly Marvel movies
- personal projects
- whatever else Aaron feels like on a given day  

# <a href="https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/">Gillespedia</a>
Gillespedia is a section of this website holding articles I wrote that fulfill a different role. Articles located in Gillespedia are not about my life, or current-day topics. They are, instead, book reviews, philosophical writings, and analyses of more general topics. Gillespedia is *not* two decades old. It's been around since roughly mid-2019, and has only existed in this form since April 2020.  It is a part of my application of [the Feynman Technique](https://doist.com/blog/feynman-technique/).

In May 2020 I began cataloguing a "Creation of the Week". I like to think of myself as a well-rounded creative person, but as time has gone on, each of my little projects have gotten lost or forgotten about. The aim of the CotW is to be a repository of my creative efforts for posterity and to function as motivation to continue creating things. 
## Typical Creations
- Columns
- Gillespedia articles
- coding projects
- drawings
- videos
- woodwork, and other physical products
- jokes (maybe someday)
- music (maybe someday)
