This blog is owned, operated, & written by Aaron Gillespie. Not [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gillespie), but a different Aaron Gillespie. One you don't know unless you know him. The guy in the photo above - the blue shirt, not the orange one.

# The Column
This blog has existed in one form or another for most of the past two decades, from section of the Xanga page for a band the author was in for 3 weeks in middle school, to a wordpress page hosted mostly by a friend, to a Tumblr right after college, to Blogger for the past 7 years, and now on GitHub Pages. Its purpose is solely for its author's entertainment. If you enjoy any portion of reading it, that's a happy side effect.

## Typical Topics
- consumer technology
- quantified self stuff
- musings on life
- movies, mostly Marvel movies
- personal projects
- Google, although less and less so
- whatever else Aaron feels like on a given day
