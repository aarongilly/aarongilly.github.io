# Writing
## The Column
The Column has existed in one form or another for most of the past two decades, from a "The Column" section of the Xanga page for a band the author was in for 3 weeks in middle school, to a WordPress page hosted by a friend, to a Tumblr right after college, to a Blogger blog for the past 7 years, and now on GitHub Pages. Its purpose is solely for its author's entertainment. If you enjoy any portion of reading it, that's a happy side effect.
Columns cover whatever topic Aaron *(which is me, by the way, I'm not sure why I committed to referring to myself in 3rd person)* feels like writing about, at the time he feels like writing about it. As such, their content is usually contemporaneous to the time and always informal.
### Typical Topics
- consumer technology
- quantified self stuff
- musings on life
- movies, mostly Marvel movies
- personal projects
- Google, although less and less so
- drawings, videos, or other "art"
- whatever else Aaron feels like on a given day  

## Gillespedia
Gillespedia is a section of this website holding articles written by Aaron that fulfill a different role. Articles located in Gillespedia are not about Aaron's life, or current topics. They are, instead, book reviews, philosophical writings, and analyses of more general topics. Gillespedia is not two decades old. It's been around since roughly mid-2019, and has only existed in this form since April 2020.  It is a part of Aaron's application of [the Feynman Technique](https://doist.com/blog/feynman-technique/). 
### Typical Topics
- Non-fiction book reviews
- Science
- Engineering
- Math
- Productivity
- Philosophy

# Development
## Google Data Studio Integration Test
I'm working my way through the [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum. I'm halfway through the entire thing. I have their Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, and Front End Libraries certifications.

My most recent Project:  
This (almost completely unstyled at the moment) [Pomodoro Timer]({{site.ur}}{{ site.baseurl }}/_pages/fcc-timer).

Also I've slowly built up a Data Journal, which I've written several Columns about. Over its 7 year life span, it's migrated from Excel, to Google Sheets, to Google Apps Script web app, and soon (hopefully), it will expand to be a fully home-grown web app. At which point I can migrate to AWS and make the whole platform available for others to use.

I'm just now experimenting with how I can integrate those things into my website.
