I am going to depricate the table below. It's uggo and I don't feel like putting in the effort to making it pretty and keeping it pretty. 

<table class="display">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Date</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</thead>
{% for member in site.data.creations %}
<tr>
<td>{{member.date}}</td>
<td>{{member.type}}</td>
<td><a href={{member.link}}>{{ member.desc }}</a></td>
</tr> 
{% endfor %}
</table>
