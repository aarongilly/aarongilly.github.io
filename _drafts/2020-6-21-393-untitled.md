What do I feel like writing about.

# Balancing Optimized Results and Enjoying the Process
I've come to see a flaw in one of my core philosophies. The idea, which I've written about on here before, is that standardized routines enable satisfactory results while freeing the mind to think about bigger and better things. The flaw I've come to realize with a blind application of this approach is that it can kill the fun of the journey.

## Coffee Example 
I make coffee at the same time every day, following the exact same set of steps. My routine produces the right amount of coffee with the right level of strength, in a minimal amount of time, and leaves me with clean counter. I can do this set of 6 steps in my sleep. Literally. I do it first thing in the morning. I've made coffee, gone back to sleep, and not remembered doing it.

The idea of here is that making coffee is now a solved problem. I no longer have to think, and therefore I'm free to consider life's bigger problems. I can think about what I want to accomplish today. I can think about how to solve a problem that's been dogging me. I can think about whatever I want, and still produce the black magical elixir of happiness. It's multichannel multitasking at its finest.

Here's the rub: because I follow this routine, the act of *making coffee* no longer provides me any level of satisfaction. It's not inherently pleasing. I don't stop and smell the beans. I have freed my mind to think about anything, and as a result I have been "freed" to use my coffee making routine as a time to continue to be anxious about this or worry about that. 

## Bath Example
I am the parent that handles bathtime around this house. It used to be a big ordeal. I'd regularly request assistance. I'd regularly have to stop in order to fetch forgotten items or go back and re-do steps. I'd have to ask my 1 year old to change positions repeatedly. Through a series of dedicated and intentional process improvements I've got a bathtime routine that I can accomplish in no more than 5 minutes, producing a satisfactorily clean child in the process.

Now that I've run out of inefficencies to smooth out, bathtime has turned into a chore. It's become a thing that I have to do, rather than a thing I enjoyed doing. My child gets to enjoy short tub times, but that's not the point.

## In Summary

> The point of life isn't to opitimze everything for time and energy, it's to enjoy things.

The solution is balance, above all else. That is and always has been my #2 Life Pro Tip[^1].

The [Creation of the Week]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/creations/) project is humming along. The page itself could use some TLC, but I'm happy to have established a public repository for creative output. I can't wait to see it in a year, or five.
