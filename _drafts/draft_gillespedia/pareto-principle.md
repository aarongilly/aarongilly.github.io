# Intro & Definition

The Pareto Principle, aka "*the 80/20 rule*", aka "*the rule of the vital few and trivial many*" is the concept in which **a small set of inputs to a function drive the majority of its output**. 

## Examples

- The richest 20% of the world have 82.7% of its wealth
- 10% of the people you work with cause 75% of the problems
- You use 5% of what you own 80% of the time

# Purpose

The principle highlights the fact that, when looking to improve the output of a system, not all inputs may be equally important. If this relationship holds true, the optimal way to optimize is to find those inputs ("the vital few") and focus heavily on controlling them. The rest of the inputs ("the trivial many") don't deserve nearly the love and attention.

# Transfer Functions

Traditionally, the values associated with this principle are 80 & 20. That is, 80 percent of the output is caused by 20 percent of the input. These numbers are somewhat arbitrary, though. The rule could just as easily be the "90/20" or the "95/10" rule. The actual ratio depends on the shape of the curve drawn by the transfer function. Transfer function, in this context, is just a mathetmatical representation of the situation, plotting all possible outputs as a result of all possible inputs. People like to keep things simple, and because terms like "transfer functions" are intimidating, we started calling it "the 80/20 rule". The 80/20 rule is a simplified and easy to remember representation of a class of functions with asymmetric transfer curves. While not a universal principle, it is common in real-world applications.

# Pareto Success Stories

## Costco
Costco's whole busines model is an application of the Pareto Principle. Originally, Costco was like most other stores. If you wanted olive oil, you went to an aisle that had ~20ft of shelf space stocked with dozens of varieties of olive oil, despite the fact that 80% of the sales were coming from the 20% of the SKUs, that 20% were **not** getting 80% of the shelf space. Costco did away with everything that wasn't a popular seller and doubled-down on those things that sold well. If you go to Costco looking for olive oil, you get *maybe* two choices... and because of the efficiences they've gained from focusing in, your two choices are both good and relatively cheap.
