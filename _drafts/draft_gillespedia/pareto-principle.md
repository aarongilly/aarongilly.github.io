# Intro & Definition

The Pareto Principle, aka "*the 80/20 rule*", aka "*the rule of the vital few and trivial many*" is the concept in which **a small set of inputs to a function drive the majority of its output**. 

## Examples

- The richest 20% of the world have 82.7% of its wealth
- 10% of the people you work with cause 80% of the problems
- You use 5% of what you own 80% of the time

# Purpose

The principle exists to highlight the fact that, when looking to improve the output of a system, not all inputs may be equally important. If this relationship holds true, the optimal way to optimize is to find those inputs ("the vital few") and focus heavily on controlling them. The rest of the inputs ("the trivial many") don't deserve nearly the love and attention.

# Pareto Principle & Transfer Functions

Traditionally, the values associated with this principle are 80 & 20. That is, 80 percent of the output is caused by 20 percent of the input. These numbers are somewhat arbitrary, though. The rule could just as easily be the "90/20" or the "95/10" rule. The actual ratio depends on the shape of the transfer function. Because terms like "transfer functions" are intimidating, people like to keep things simple. The 80/20 rule is a simplified and easy to remember representation of a class of functions with non-linear plots. While not a universal principle, it is common in real-world applications.
