**Upfront caveat:** I'm by no means the most successful person in the world. I'm not even the most successful person in this *house*. I'm just the most successful person who is sitting at this particular keyboard at the moment. I may not be the most impressive person you'll ever meet, but I consider myself successful most of the time.

# A Technique for Personal Productivity

There are a **lot** of things I do to be "productive". Most of them *(if not all)* are sourced from great thinkers who came before me. The technique I'm about to outline borrows heavily from a lot of them. 

## Components

- **Inbox** - a unified place to capture tasks, ideas, and whatever else you need
- **Task Manager** - a time-bound task management system, ideally with a "reminders" feature
- **Projects List** - a place to organize the efforts you're taking to achieve some larger outcome
- **Goals List** - a place to list the things you want to accomplish and/or the person you want to be
- **Areas List** - a list of the different aspects of your life that you care about & maintain
