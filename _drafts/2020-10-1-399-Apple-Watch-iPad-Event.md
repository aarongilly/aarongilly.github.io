Eagle eyed readers will note this is the 2nd time I've posted a "#399" Column. I had my numbering off upon closer examination (in preparation for my 400th Column celebration... see next time). The number has since been fixed, which means you probably got duplicate email notifications for the same post on subsequent weeks. My bad. I get bothered by inconsistencyes and misteaks. That shou**ld**n't be a surpr*ise* to most of ewe.

# Apple One  
Cool. So my last post ((about subscription service)[https://aarongilly.com/398-tools/#top-5-digital-subscriptions-i-dont-have-but-probably-should] didn't age well. Apple gone and done it. They've created an Apple subscription services bundle. They named it "Apple One", and the fact that nobody I've seen has called them on their complete replication of the "Google One" subscription service naming convention just goes to show how completely nonimpactful Google One has been.

## Apple One Tiers
There are 3 levels of Apple One. All of them get you Music, Arcade, and TV+. They also each get you some level of iCloud storage, ranging from homopatheic[^1] amounts of storage, to legitimate amounts. The highest tier grants access to a couple other services as well.

| Tier       | Price            | Music | Arcade | iCloud | TV+ | News+ | Fitness+ |
|------------|------------------|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|----------|
| Individual | $15/mo (1 user)  | ✅     | ✅      | 50GB   | ✅   | ❌     | ❌        |
| Family     | $20/mo (6 users) | ✅     | ✅      | 200GB  | ✅   | ❌     | ❌        |
| Premier    | $30/mo (6 users) | ✅     | ✅      | 2TB    | ✅   | ✅     | ✅        |

### Services
If you don't know what they are.
* Apple Music - is the 2nd most-used music streaming service (behind Spotify)
* Apple Arcade - a library of curated (supposedly quite good) mobile & Apple TV games, all 100% free of advertising and microtransactions
* iCloud - the 3rd or 4th place player in the consumer cloud storage marketplace, behind Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and *maybe* Dropbox? This data is hard to find.
* TV+ - a video streaming service that exists
* News+ - a sort of mass print media bundled subscription, which gets you access to a ton of magazines & newspapers (notably NOT the New York Times, though)
* Fitness+ - seemingly a competitor to Beachbody &/or Peloton in the space of workout classes you do at home... time well tell exactly what this is

## Another Matrix of Technological Coverage
Turns out I make these sorts of lists frequently ((example 0)[https://aarongilly.com/44-master-tech-comparison-column/], (example 1)[https://aarongilly.com/199-feature-tech-setup/], (example 2)[https://aarongilly.com/337-apple-icosystem/], (example 3)[https://aarongilly.com/378-macbook/), and (example 4)[https://aarongilly.com/392-jack-of-most-trades/]). 

Assumptions: you have a family of at least 3 people to consider & no pre-existing service lock-in.

### Case Breakdown
This whole post lead up to this analysis. I'm going to use it as the Top 5. See below.

# Apple Watch SE
Unless you have medical conditions that EKGs and/or Blood Oxygen readings are good for, the Apple Watch SE seems like it's the Apple Watch to get. Call me crazy. Always on screens just aren't important enough.

I guess that's all I had to say about that. I'd like nab up one of these at some point.
