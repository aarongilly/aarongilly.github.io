Eagle eyed readers will note this is the 2nd time I've posted a "#399" Column. I had my numbering off upon closer examination (in preparation for my 400th Column celebration... see next time). The number has since been fixed, which means you probably got duplicate email notifications for the same post on subsequent weeks. My bad. I get bothered by inconsistencyes and misteaks. That shou**ld**n't be a surpr*ise* to most of ewe.

# Apple One  
Cool. So my last post ((about subscription service)[https://aarongilly.com/398-tools/#top-5-digital-subscriptions-i-dont-have-but-probably-should] didn't age well. 

## Another Matrix of Technological Coverage
Turns out I make these sorts of lists frequently ((example 0)[https://aarongilly.com/44-master-tech-comparison-column/], (example 1)[https://aarongilly.com/199-feature-tech-setup/], (example 2)[https://aarongilly.com/337-apple-icosystem/], (example 3)[https://aarongilly.com/378-macbook/), and (example 4)[https://aarongilly.com/392-jack-of-most-trades/]).

Assumptions: you have a family of at least 3 people to consider & no pre-existing service lock-in.

# Second Main Topic
## Second Topic Header Two
Dont need text between heading 1 and heading 2, but it's okay to have it, too.  
- bulleted
- lists need
- a blank line after

This text would glom onto the bullet otherwise. This is how to footnote[^1]

The [first post on this blog](https://aarongilly.com/1-why-do-this-thing-again/) is dated **March 16, 2012**. The subsequent 398 posts were written with no appreciable dead space between them:

While that histogram is clearly left-skewed, I'm frankly a bit shocked I still do this. Not only that, I've gotten much *better* than I was (this, of course, sets me up for a future where I stumble back across this text after having forgotten it, and scoff at the gumption I had to assert this is, by any definition, "good").
