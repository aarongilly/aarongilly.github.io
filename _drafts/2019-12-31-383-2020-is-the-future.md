Doesn't it seem like 2020 has always been *"the future!"*. Technically as of this writing, that's still true... but almost assuredly for you reading this it is **not** true. What's the future like, guys? Are you flying around in your jetpacks? Has the singularity happened yet? I can't wait for *the world of tomorrow*.  
Long-term planning.  
Goal mapping.  
Principles.  

Some darn pictures for a change.
