I know this is premature - but why does "400" sounds like a bigger number than "500"?

# Top Header  
Some content. 

## Heading two  
Blank lines between headers work well. Two spaces after every necessary line break is good.

# De-Googling
## Background
Dont need text between heading 1 and heading 2, but it's okay to have it, too.  
- bulleted
- lists need
- a blank line after

This text would glom onto the bullet otherwise. This is how to footnote[^1]

# Top 5: Digital Subscriptions I Use
{: style="color: red"}
1. Netflix - $13/mo (standard) - it's Netflix. What are you going to do, **not** have Netflix?
2. Spotify Premium Family - $15/mo - simply the best music subscription service. Would be nice if they offered anything beyond "streaming audio content"... but it's a price we're willing to pay.
3. Google One - $10/mo for 2TB - this is essentially just Google Drive, but they wanted to make it sound like more than that.
3. LastPass Family - $4/mo - Password Manager. Very worth it.
4. Glitch - $8/mo - hosts my WebApps
Pinecast - $5/mo - hosts my Podcasts
Notion - $4/mo - hosts my notes & a lot of other stuff... although at this point they made the free version of it incredibly capable, paying isn't really necessary for the normal user
5. Amazon Prime - $10/mo (basically) - Amazon Prime is essentially a no-brainer for most of America. You could live pretty comfortably with ONLY an Amazon Prime subscription. They've got At this point I sort of see Amazon Prime's annual subscription cost sort of like "paying taxes", only instead of getting the privledge to have a military that protects us and a school system and whatnot, we get all the Amazon benefits. Same thing could be said of my Costco membership, but that's a different Top 5.

# Top 5: Digital Subscriptions I Don't Use, but Probably Should 
{: style="color: red"}
1. HBO Max - $15/mo - this streaming service is a direct competitor to Netflix, and it's catalog is incredible.
2. Dropbox - $10/mo for 2TB - I use Google Drive, but man do I like Dropbox. It was my first introduciton to "the cloud". Also their "Paper" online document editor, while not as robust as Google Docs, is satisfying to use. It's a shame that right now Google Drive is sufficing for everything I use - and more and more we're locked into it.
3. Apple Arcade - $5/mo - a subscription service that nets you access to a curated library of iPhone & iPad games, all of which are free from ads & microtransactions. When my kid gets older, this is 100% happening if it's still around.
4. YouTube Premium - $12/mo (single) or $18/mo (family) - YouTube without ads. YouTube downloads. Also Google's Spotify competitor "YouTube Musix". If this wasn't nearly $20/mo we'd probably opt in. Also if Spotify wasn't so good. Also also if I weren't 80% confident Google will see a squirrel and drop this service entirely.
5. The Hulu/Disney Plus/ESPN bundle - $13/mo - Hulu and Disney Plus, what else could you want? Honestly with the inclusion of ESPN here, how does ANYONE have cable still? It's either lack of good internet or fear of change. There's no reason to not be a cord-cutter anymore.
