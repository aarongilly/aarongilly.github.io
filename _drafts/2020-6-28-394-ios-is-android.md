## Breakfast

Let's set the record straight: Breakfast is the *least* important meal of the day. You can easily skip it without causing yourself major problems. As a matter of fact, the "standard" breakfast foods are usually high in carbs and low in nutritional value. They may give you a temporary boost of energy, but will leave you with less energy than if you'd just eaten nothing at all.  
"Intermittent fasting" is essentially just a fancy name skipping breakfast, by the way. Technically it also includes "no snacking" outside of the window between lunch and dinner... but yeah. It's an overly complicated name for an incredibly simple concept.
