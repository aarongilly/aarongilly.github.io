Intro bit if you like. Don’t forget to delete tags you’re not using & set the excerpt at the end. Remember the [kramdown ref](kramdown-ref.md)

# Top Header  
Some content. 

## Heading two  
Blank lines between headers work well. Two spaces after every necessary line break is good.

# Second Main Topic
## Second Topic Header Two
Dont need text between heading 1 and heading 2, but it's okay to have it, too.  
- bulleted
- lists need
- a blank line after

While that histogram is clearly left-skewed, I'm frankly a bit shocked I still do this. Not only that, I've gotten much *better* than I was (this, of course, sets me up for a future where I stumble back across this text after having forgotten it, and scoff at the gumption I had to assert this is, by any definition, "good").
