This Wednesday (8/12/2020) was the series finale of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. If you've never watched the show, which frankly is all of you (except maybe ~2?) just go ahead and skip riiiight down to that Top 5 and quote. They aren't related.

The debut of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC back in 2013 was tied in with probably my highest Marvel Cinematic Universe hype. This was back when I was making spreadsheets to track the in-continuity storyline. This was back when I bugged my fiance about superhero shows incessantly. Believe it or not, things are actually very different now... but this Column isn't about now, it's about S.H.I.E.L.D., and my relationship to it.

# A Multi-Platform Universe  
The concept that came with this show was one of a television show that closely tied in with a series of movies, in real time. They were to play off each other, storylines weaving back and forth between them. For the first couple of seasons, that was still (essentially) the promise. Sometime around the introduction of the Netflix, it started to dawn on me... "it's all connected" had a huge asterisk.

> It's All Connected*
> 
> *to the movies. Also the platforms will never recognize the existance of the other platforms. The ABC shows will never reference the Netflix shows. The Hulu shows will never reference ABC or Netflix. Netflix will never reference ABC or Hulu. 

It was somewhere around this realization that I sort of "gave up" on caring *too much* about Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., or Daredevil/Jessica Jones/Luke Cage/Iron Fist/The Defenders/The Punisher on Netflix, or The Runaways/Cloak and Dagger on Hulu.

I want to see a graphic like that, but more detailed. All 23 movies and all 29 season TV shows, with arrows between them representing direct references. Something more substantial than a throwaway line. Nohting in Doctor Strange cares about Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, for example. Maybe I'll work on this in my spare time at some point. I've only seen 25 of those 29 seasons.

It LOOKS like the Disney+ shows are going to be first-class citizens of the MCU. I read somewhere that Kevin Feige outright said that plotlines from the shows will be addressed in later movies. So maybe I'll be on board for those.

# Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Major Story Arcs
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was a dense show. One thing I always appreciated about it was how quickly they moved on. Things other shows would turn into an entire season tended to be 2 or 3 episode arcs.

Dont need text between heading 1 and heading 2, but it's okay to have it, too.  
- bulleted
- lists need

This text would glom onto the bullet otherwise. This is how to footnote[^1]
