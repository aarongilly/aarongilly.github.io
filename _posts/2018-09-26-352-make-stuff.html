<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Hamburgers are Fun on a Bun</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">File this Column under "Aaron tells other people what they should be doing", which I realize is too common of a theme.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">You know what's fun? You know what's rewarding? Honing a skill. Creating something new. Doing a craft. Working on something just because you want to.&nbsp;</span>It's a lot more fun than enjoying someone else's work. It's a lot more <i>lasting</i>&nbsp;fun than enjoying someone else's work.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Creating things brings a sort of whole-brain engagement that only happens with the absolute best of storytelling. I wrote this Life Tracker thing to keep track of all sorts of different aspects of my life so I might be able to read through the data what makes me most happy... what I found out was that what made me most happy was actually BUILDING the thing. Doing the data work. I was more than just coding - I was creating. I was generating a thing that had never existed before and the possibilities were endless. That's really exciting. More exciting than figuring out who killed the person in the first act and how the CSI team solved the case.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I hate those shows.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I loved the show "Making It". It was a short, brisk series that was hosted by two people that seemed like genuine friends. They had a simple message - things made by hand are more meaningful than things that aren't. It was a genuine blast watching the creators in that show take a simple idea &amp; some supplies and turn them into works of art - very <i>different</i>&nbsp;works of art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Anyway, I'm not advocating changing everything wholesale in life. I think that my most pervasive real-world motto is "keep everything in moderation." Another person might have a different way of phrasing that... I'll give you a hint about the person - he's very crappily drawn right below this text.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Favorite Stuff I've Made</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. This Thanos drawing - my best digital work work for now</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i46eL-v_wK8/W6W4iBgmwLI/AAAAAAADeO4/gKjfMO0wjzQmllgRYD41ZNorPp-BYBW_wCLcBGAs/s1600/sketch1526697110311.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1067" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i46eL-v_wK8/W6W4iBgmwLI/AAAAAAADeO4/gKjfMO0wjzQmllgRYD41ZNorPp-BYBW_wCLcBGAs/s640/sketch1526697110311.png" width="426" /></a></div><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"><br class="kix-line-break" />4.
