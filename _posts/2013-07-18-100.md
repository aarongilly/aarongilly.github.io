# Motto: Things are Crazy, and Crazy is Good

It's been a long time since I've had a legitimate column update. There's a good reason for that - everything has changed:
* Melissa's back.
* My room is all different.
* My free time is spent in a new, different, much less lonesome manner.
* Work started taking more of my time, resources, and mental faculties. 
* Wedding plans are in the early stages.
* Workouts have been two-tiered & double-sided.
* My diet has changed.
* I have to deal with a cat more often than I would like.
* I've spent time with family; not so much my now family, but more of my soon family.
* Many projects have been temporarily shelved.
* Big plans are being formulated.
* The amount of live music I listen to skyrocketed.
* Google.
* One of my best friends tied the knot.
* I saw a group of some of my favorite people on the planet.
* This is the 100th Column (on Blogger, at least).
* There are still tons of things I want to write about.
* I made this video:
