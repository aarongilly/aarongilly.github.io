<div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Well That's Disappointing</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In 2014, when Google announced the Nexus 6 that was a huge personal disappointment, they announced a few other things that I passed on. My car isn't running "Android Auto" and my television isn't running Android TV... any more.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I had read reviews for the NVIDIA SHIELD console (later rebranded as NVIDIA SHIELD TV, which seems like it's just screaming itself at you) for the past 5 months. It had been on my Amazon wish list since the first week it was available. On a lark, I decided to swing by the local Micro Center (electronics store) to see if they had one in stock. To my surprise/delight, they had exactly one in stock. I picked it up and took it home, filled with glee. I plugged it in, booted it up, logged in, and started playing around.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Then the problems started.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nothing huge. Just... a bunch of little things. The Chromecast functionality was spotty. The audio cut out from time to time. The applications available on the Google Play Store were limited. I expected </span><b>all</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> of the Android Apps I know and love to be available; but instead there was only the "Android TV" apps. There are far fewer of those.&nbsp;</span>I was able to find a Super Nintendo Emulator, but not an N64 emulator like I hoped. I looked for Android TV games, but literally reached the end of the sum-total list of all games available on the platform. Not much there. Nothing at all I was interested in, lots of "Freemium" games. Other things I wasn't interested in.<br /><br />The game <i>streaming</i> feature worked well. I was able to play Hitman from my computer on my television in the living room. That was the highlight of my experience with the device. Battlefield 4 wasn't really doable. The small amount of lag induced by the stream killed any chance I had at being competitive. Also, keyboard + mouse &gt;&gt;&gt; gamepads for first-person shooters.<br /><br />SO, there I was. With a $200 device that functioned slightly worse than the $35 Chromecast that had been there before, and didn't have much value-add (aside from being able to play <i>local</i>&nbsp;videogames from my PC on the television)... &nbsp;It just didn't justify the cost.<br /><br />So I returned it. No sweat. Micro Center is great.<br /><br />While I was there - I decided to pick up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>. It's a $35 barebones computer-on-a-board. When I say "barebones", I really mean barebones:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e94O5ts7Aio/VjT0ha6jGmI/AAAAAAACAKI/s5zvWYd2OY0/s1600/%2523262%2B-%2BRaspberry%2BPi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e94O5ts7Aio/VjT0ha6jGmI/AAAAAAACAKI/s5zvWYd2OY0/s1600/%2523262%2B-%2BRaspberry%2BPi.jpg" /></a></div><br />That picture is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Project-Board/dp/B00T2U7R7I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446310831&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Raspberry+Pi">their Amazon page</a>. I suggest picking one up from a store, though. Two dollars cheaper there. Anyway, that's a whole computer. A $35 computer that you can do TONS of stuff with. I am very interested in exploring what I can build.<br /><br />I want to start putting my degree to use... in addition to the learning I've done since that time.<br /><br />Some day, I'm going to have a shop/gym/pool room. That's going to be sweet.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Raspberry Pi Projects in Which I am Initially Interested</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_8Xhzt5YQI">A real-world Mjolnir</a>&nbsp;- (this one was built with an Arduino... but it could be done with a Raspberry Pi... or I could just do it with an Arduino, too)<br class="kix-line-break" />4. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LapPi-A-Raspberry-Pi-Netbook/">Franken-laptop built out of a briefcase</a>&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />3. <a href="http://michaelteeuw.nl/post/84026273526/and-there-it-is-the-end-result-of-the-magic">Magic Mirror</a><br class="kix-line-break" />2. <a href="http://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-web-server/">Web Server</a>&nbsp;- I want to get this going Essay Pee<br class="kix-line-break" />1. <a href="http://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-emulator/">Retro Game Emulator</a>&nbsp;- I actually already did this.
