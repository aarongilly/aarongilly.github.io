<span style="color: #ff9900; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Motto:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Hey/Okay Siri/Alexa/Cortana/Google, are you hearing me?</b></span><br /><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Technology is <i>cool</i>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I think we are on the cusp of a cool, new, and exciting future in the world of consumer tech. #BoldPrediction</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">It used to be that geeks thought "some day soon, everyone will have a PC".&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Then it was "some day soon, everyone will be on the internet".&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Then it was "some day soon, everyone will have a smartphone".&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Now I think some day soon, everyone will have a smart home.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">More than that, a smart </span><i style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">everything</i><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I expect most people already have at LEAST 3 of the following items:</span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">computer</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">smartphone</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">tablet</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">smart TV &amp;/or streaming box &amp;/or gaming console</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">smart wearable device (smart watch, fitness tracker, etc)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">internet-connected car</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">internet-connected speakers</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">any number of smart "home automation" devices (smart thermostat, smart lights,&nbsp;surveillance</span><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">&nbsp;camera, etc)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Amazon's "Echo", which is really a new category of device</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I think that <b>the next big thing will be the connection of those pieces</b>... intelligently organized and orchestrated through cloud services. You'll see product categories like Amazon's always-listening personal assistance "Echo" device become more common. All of these "smart" products will learnt to behave and interoperate with one-another under a common language, accessible from any of your various devices. Let's explore this using the following hypothetical situation:</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><i>You wake up to the smell of fresh-brewed coffee. Your coffee maker is hooked into your phone's alarm so it knows when you're about to wake up and has a pot ready for you. You go to the bathroom and weigh yourself as you get ready for work. Your scale reports your weight to your phone. You make breakfast with the television on. It flips through the latest photos you've taken on your phone or edited on your computer. You're looking at your tablet to see your calendar for the week and notice your latest fitness metrics as measured on your wearable device and your scale are both pointing in a negative direction. You use your watch to make a reminder to work out on Saturday. Noticing the time, you ask the room "does my car need gas?". Your always listening device pings your car for that information and relays the response through your connected speakers. You do need gas, so you have to leave for work a little bit early. Work is crazy busy. You barely have time to use the bathroom, much less stand in a line for lunch. You order a burrito by tapping your wrist so you can skip the line when you get there. After lunch, a package you ordered is delivered to your place. Your phone alerts you that someone is at your door. You're able to greet the delivery man, unlock the door, have him leave the package inside, then re-lock it as he leaves. You were excited for this package, so you decide to come home early. Your phone notifies you there's been automobile accident on your normal route home and automatically reroutes you around traffic. Your phone then sends a message to your thermostat to start cooling down the house in preparation for your arrival.&nbsp;</i></span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">All of those things are <b>very</b> possible with today's tech. The only thing is needed is a little bit of coordination between services. If Google's "On Hub" router becomes an always-listening "Google Now" device, if you have an Android Auto car, Android Wear device, Android phone, Chromecast/Android TV, and a computer with a Google account, you could do almost all of those things. If you have AT&amp;T's "Digital Life", a Nest thermostat &amp; dropcam, a "Ring" video doorbell, or really any other sufficient home-automation setup, this is all within the realm of immediate possibility... and that's cool.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I predict that these things will become more and more common place. It will slowly become just an assumed part of any home. Realtors will have to specify when a home does NOT support wide automation. That's my #BoldPrediction.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">What an exciting time we live in.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span id="goog_925491678"></span><span id="goog_925491679"></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qhXfWy2-n7c/ViFu1cuMM-I/AAAAAAAB_RM/8AJneCCdB-k/s1600/%2523269%2B-%2BAndroid%2BEverywhere.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qhXfWy2-n7c/ViFu1cuMM-I/AAAAAAAB_RM/8AJneCCdB-k/s1600/%2523269%2B-%2BAndroid%2BEverywhere.jpg" /></a></div><br /><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;"><b>"I'm Living in the Future" Moments I've Had</b></span></div><div><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">5.
