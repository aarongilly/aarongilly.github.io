<div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Keep It Simple, Stupid</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I suck at what I'm about to write about.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">An overarching theme for most of my posts lately (and because my writing so closely relates to my thinking, an overarching theme of most of my thinking lately), is how perfection is </span><b>truly </b><span style="font-weight: normal;">unattainable. Not only personal perfection/perfection of the self, but the perfect tool, the perfect photo, the perfect <i>anything. </i>None if it&nbsp;doesn't really exists... but nearly everything I deal with on a day-to-day basis is </span><b>good enough</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">. I need to learn to live with good enough (in moderation).</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>Example given:</i></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I love containers. It's kind of an embarrassing or stupid thing to even admit; but I love them. I love how they organize the things we need and how they make those things easier to move around.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I love backpacks and messenger bags.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I love waterbottles and lunchboxes.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">To stick with </span>one <span style="font-weight: normal;">example for the sake of argument, let's look at containers meant for drinking out of - I'll loosely call them </span><b>waterbottles</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I own a <i>lot</i>. They generally fall into a few different types.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Large, uninsulated Nalgene bottle</b></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime;">They hold a lot. They are dishwashable. They can be stored in the refrigerator to insure you've always got cold water. They are tough as nails.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i>...but...</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red;">They don't maintain temperature. They sweat a lot. They don't really fit <i>in</i>&nbsp;anything. They are heavy when they're full. They can't be used for hot liquids.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Small, insulated Hydroflask</b></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: normal;">They are small enough to fit anywhere. They don't sweat. They are very portable. They maintain temperature. They aren't terribly heavy when full.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>...but...</i></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">They constantly need refilled. They are a bit of a pain to drink out of unless you get a fancy lid. They aren't dishwasher safe and therefore difficult to clean. Also they hold so little that if you <i>do</i>&nbsp;put something in them that requires you to clean them out afterwards you're getting a full amount of hassle for a partial amount of benefit. They are prone to dings.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Large, insulated Hydroflask</b></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime;">They hold a lot. They don't sweat. They maintain temperature.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i>...but...</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red;">They are a bit of a pain to drink out of unless you get a fancy lid. They aren't dishwasher safe. They don't fit most places &amp; are heavy.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">They are prone to dings.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Large, insulated tumbler</b></div><span style="color: lime;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">They hold a lot. They don't sweat. They maintain temperature. They are easy to drink out of. They fit in nearly all cup holders.</span></span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i>...but...</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red;">They aren't dishwasher safe. Their lids aren't water-tight, therefore they can't be packed away and forgotten about.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Tervis insulated tumblers</b></div><span style="color: lime;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">They come in two sizes. They don't sweat. They maintain temperature. They are easy to drink out of. They fit in nearly all&nbsp;cup holders. They are dishwasher safe.</span></span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i>...but...</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red;">Even their big size doesn't hold all that much. Their lids aren't water-tight, therefore they can't be packed away and forgotten about. Some how I manage to always dribble or spill a bit of whatever I'm drinking.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Small, uninsulated Blender Bottle</b></div><span style="color: lime;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">The blender ball makes protein drinks easy. They usually fit in most cup holders. Their lids are usually safe enough to not worry about leaks.</span></span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i>...but...</i></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red;">They don't maintain temperature. They are annoying to clean. They generally are pretty small. They make a rattling sound if they're empty. They break too easily (in my experience).&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In matrix form:</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-om1vAwZYHDs/XRF4Ace68EI/AAAAAAAD-xU/Ljr_JAVxNos4Mb4FPw_6JSDZ9G1pwz7-gCLcBGAs/s1600/%2523373%2B-%2BGood%2Benough.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="504" data-original-width="1132" height="284" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-om1vAwZYHDs/XRF4Ace68EI/AAAAAAAD-xU/Ljr_JAVxNos4Mb4FPw_6JSDZ9G1pwz7-gCLcBGAs/s640/%2523373%2B-%2BGood%2Benough.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">But here's the deal - </span><b>every single one</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> of those options <i>work</i>. They are all <i>fine</i>. Each of them could <i>easily</i>&nbsp;be my "main" option that I use for everything. I could learn to live with and work around whatever flaws any given option has. They don't even have to be viewed as flaws. They are only flaws because I choose to think of them that way.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The same thing can be said about any of my backpacks or messenger bags. The same thing could be said about my Chromebook vs an iPad. The same thing could be said about the iPhone and any of the various Android phones I've drooled over. The same thing could be said about Google Sheets and Airtable. The same thing could be said about Google Sites or Google Drive or Notion as a host for Gillespedia.com. The same thing could be said about todoist, Things 3, Google Tasks, Microsoft Todo, Wunderlist, or Google Keep. The same thing could be said about </span><b>most things</b>&nbsp;I've spent days and weeks and months thinking about.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Do I regret that time? No, not really. Maybe some of it. Mostly I regret the <i>anxiety</i>. I've spent unnecessary effort trying curtail imaginary situations in which not having feature X causes me serious harm. I've spent more time in my life than I care to admit looking at options for which liquid vessel I wanted to take to work for a given day. Do I want portability? Do I want to bring the blender bottle?</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Moreover, I own more crap than I need. Seriously. I have 6 Nalgene bottles, 2 HydroFlasks, one of those Yeti tumblers (mine's a knockoff cause who cares), 2 Tervis Tumblers, and 2 Blender Bottles. My cabinet overfloweth with cups. I own 3 backpacks and 4 messenger bags. I've owned 6 lunchboxes in the past 5 years... and not one of them was "ruined", they all just "could have been better". I own a Chromebook that is an incredible piece of technology, and yet I found myself looking at iPads the other day because my Chromebook is 2 years old. That's <i>insane</i>. That the behavior of a rampant consumerist sheep.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Unrelated to the above.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Sleep. Deep sleep, specifically. It's a precious thing. I've been having trouble with it lately due to having a sick kid. It makes things difficult. If "having a thrown-off biorhythm" is a real thing, it does that. I went two nights with no single span of sleep lasting longer than probably ~2 hours, and on that 3rd day I think I dropped more pens, water bottles, cell phones, pieces of paper, and whatever else you pick up on a daily basis than I did in all of the month of May. A lack of sleep shows you how fragile a well-working brain is. I still am operating at ~70% capacity, if it's not clear from this writing.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Flaws in apps I called "Flawless" in <a href="http://www.aarongilly.com/2019/06/371-aim-immediate-followup.html" target="_blank">Column #371</a>'s Top 5</span></div><span style="color: red; font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">5. Apple's Clock App - Active alarms are not highlighted well. Given their standard huge list of alarms at slightly different times-approach to an alarm app, I shouldn't have to scroll the list to be sure there is an alarm on. They should put the active alarms at the top of the list.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">4. Google Photos - I'd like the ability to have my Google Photos backed up to my local machine automatically. Of all my digital files, photos are the most precious, most irreplaceable... as much as I trust Google, I don't trust that something terrible couldn't happen to them. So I'm manually downloading them. It's a pain.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">3. Pocket Casts - Podcast transcripts would be great. Also having to pay for the web interface keeps me from widely recommending the app. It didn't support CarPlay.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">2. LastPass - This one is tougher. LastPass is pretty stellar. It's organization scheme is a bit unnecessary. My website logins don't need to be in folders. It's a bit unclear to me how sharing passwords works, too.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">1. Pocket - There are other apps that can do the core of what Pocket does that also do a <i>looot </i>of other stuff. Pocket allows you to save articles for later and notate them. So does Evernote, Notion, and other .</span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"To be happy we need something to solve.
