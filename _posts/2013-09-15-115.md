I don't have much to say today. 

If you enjoy things that are funny, you should watch this video:

EDITOR'S NOTE FROM THE FUTURE - this video is gone now. :-(

I was the top post on Reddit's "r/tall" sub a few days back. I posted this picture:

That picture has been viewed over 25 thousand times, according to the hosting service.

I've been taking a break from Life Tracking lately. I'm not sure where the motivation went, but it's certainly gone somewhere. I do have 14 full weeks tracked, but I've been supposedly doing this since 21 weeks ago. 

My original goal was to do it for a year... or half a year at least. That's going to take a while when I keep taking weeks off.

I've turned Melissa into a fellow Dominion player. She beat be today... two times... out of two games.

In order to keep with what I normally write about, I should probably just say this:
Apple iPhone 5S. Samsung Smartwatch. GoPro action camera. Fitness. Fitness. Android. Fitness.

Oh, and I should mention that I have received several bits of fantastic news lately that has made my week awesome. None of those things are really my business to write about, though. Just use your imagination.
