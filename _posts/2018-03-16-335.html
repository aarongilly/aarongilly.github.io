<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: The Adventure Begins...</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's some notes-to-self from my Google Keep that I originally wrote with the intention of exploring at a greater length on here, but given that I write about this sort of crap all the time, I'm just going to write them verbatim from my notes:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Always explore. Always try new things.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Happiness is not that hard.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Happiness follows healthiness. You feel healthy when you're exercising regularly, brushing your teeth, cooking nutritious meals and eating them, sleeping enough, and working on creating projects that hone talents and stimulate the brain.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Happiness also follows a sense of control. You don't feel in control when you're giving into your "immediate gratification" impulses.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Splitting your attention between things is a fleeting contentment that ultimately givesway to a sense of existential dread. It's always better to be fully into doing one thing than to be halfway doing two things.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">--- Okay that's done. Next up.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I just found out I was born in the Chinese year of the Dragon. That's cool. Dragons are cool. Mythical creatures are cool.&nbsp;</span>Refrigerators are cool, on the inside. I like the idea of folklore involving mythical creatures. Something about it I find very charming.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Jessica Jones season 2 was okay. Jessica Jones season 1 is probably right behind&nbsp;</span>The Punisher as my favorite of the Netflix Marvel series. Actually let's make this official:<br /><br />Aaron's official ranking of the Marvel Netflix series:<br />1. The Punisher<br />2. Jessica Jones S1<br />3. Daredevil S1<br />4. The Defenders<br />5. Luke Cage<br />6. Daredevil S2<br />7. Jessica Jones S2<br />8. Iron Fist, featuring Danny Rand, the Immortal Iron Fist, Protector of K'un Lun and Sworn Enemy of The Hand<br /><br />The photo to go out on:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jpN_9e57inU/Wqwt3BO3l_I/AAAAAAAC69w/rValxR3VvIQ_o0QjYEig5LywH8Wrc02VQCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180315_230236.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jpN_9e57inU/Wqwt3BO3l_I/AAAAAAAC69w/rValxR3VvIQ_o0QjYEig5LywH8Wrc02VQCKgBGAs/s640/IMG_20180315_230236.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />That's how you pack.<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Only Rules You Need to Play 8 Ball Billiards (a.k.a. "Regular Pool")</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. Players take turns shooting their balls (solids or stripes) until all their balls are pocketed; they then win the game by pocketing the 8 ball. Pocketing the 8 ball with any of their balls still on the table or pocketing any ball (or committing a foul) in the same shot as the 8 ball is pocketed is a loss.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. All shots must be called by indicating which ball will go into which pocket (with no need for further specificity). This includes (but is not limited to) the 8 ball shot.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />3. Your turn continues until you fail to make the shot you called or commit a foul.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />2. Fouls include causing a ball to go off the table, not making contact with your ball first, failing to drive any ball into a pocket or a rail, or pocketing the cue ball.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. All fouls result in ball-in-hand.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quotestream:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"What are the rules?"&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: lime;"><i>- Josh</i></span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"I'm not entirely sure on the rules"&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: lime;"><i>- Jon</i></span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"No rules got it."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Josh</span></div>
