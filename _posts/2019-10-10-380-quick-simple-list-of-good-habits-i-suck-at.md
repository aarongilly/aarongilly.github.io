It's been a while since I've written. I have had a lot of heavy trains of thought in that time. Daunting ones that would take a lot of time and energy to write about. Stuff like "time" and "energy". Instead of doing that, I'm going to make a simple, little list.

# Good Habits I Suck At

TEST TEMP UPLOAD!

# Top 5: Good Habits I'm Actually Quite Good At

1. Cable cutting... I just never had it to begin with. So this is cheating.
2. 
3. 
4. Sleeping consistently enough hours. The hours I do move around a lot, but I do usually get 7 contiguous hours, provided my child sleeps well enough.
5. Talking with my spouse. A lot. I mean. I think I'm good. I haven't asked her opinion on the matter.
