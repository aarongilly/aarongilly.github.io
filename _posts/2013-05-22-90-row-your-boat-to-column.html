There I met a new old man and had this conversation. It started when I told him life seemed deathly hard - it's simply too difficult.  He said -  <i>"You should think a little bigger. You aren't failing to succeed, you are working to success through failure. It's alright to be all wrong; because once your fails pass, you'll find what's left is what's right."</i> What he was saying sounded awfully good.  <i>"Let me tell you a true story - Originally, I just copied others. I had been a minority in a major way. Then I was stuck in the same quest to be different... and it was pretty ugly. My attempts were really fake. I felt like everyone hated me. I was even at odds with myself..."</i> He paused to watch some kids play. He only stopped to continue.  <i>"Now then, the past is a present. The new days, they're here. You're forgetting to remember the victories. You need to remember to forget your defeats. They are old news - stop going there. Consider yourself fortunately unfortunate. You've had to push yourself to pull through. Don't accept a decline in your life. Keep changing! You can't fill a tall glass in short order. With effort, things will come easier. Once you get afoot, you will get ahead. Your failures will increasingly decrease; and as things come to pass, you'll have found you never really lost." </i>As he started to finish, I thought about us. We sat there together, alone with our conversation. I looked dumbly at the wise man.  What he said seemed quite possibly impossible.  I mean, he was nice; but I was certainly uncertain of what he meant.  I clearly misunderstood.  Good grief.</span></span></div><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #ff9900; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XFSmhmijRqY/UZ1swT7EHqI/AAAAAAAA0bg/q08sFMRMY9k/s1600/I+have+no+idea+what+I'm+doing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="172" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XFSmhmijRqY/UZ1swT7EHqI/AAAAAAAA0bg/q08sFMRMY9k/s320/I+have+no+idea+what+I'm+doing.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When it comes to poetry:</td></tr></tbody></table><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></b><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Top 5: Things I </span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: red; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><i>could</i> have written about instead of posting that poem</span></div><span style="color: red; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">5. I updated my Life Tracker. I added a new feature and it only took about 20 minutes of coding. I'm doubly proud.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. My workouts have been getting easier despite the fact I keep adding more weight. <br class="kix-line-break" />3. I think poetry has a bad rap. There's a stigma associated with someone who reads, writes, and/or enjoys poetry... and that's not cool. I appreciate good wordplay. <br class="kix-line-break" />2. I made a video just to make a video. It's funny-ish, but too low-brow for the Column's high standards.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. I updated my second-a-day video. I have the timing worked out for the rest of the video, and it works perfectly. It took some doing and some creativity - but it's going to be worth it in a couple months when I'm done.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="color: lime; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Quote:</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="color: lime; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="color: lime; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Most of the things you call 'oxymorons' in your poem are just antonyms”</span><span style="color: lime; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" />- Melissa; truthfully, though, I had to tell her to say this so I could say she said it -</span><div class="blogger-post-footer">If you noticed my new footer, I'm impressed.</div>
