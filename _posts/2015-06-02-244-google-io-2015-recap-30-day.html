<div><span style="color: #ff9900; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Darn.</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Google I/O 2015 happened yesterday. I wrote in my last Column about my hopes to walk away from it without disappointment. Unfortunately, it didn't even take the whole keynote for me to realize that's exactly what I'd be doing. Maybe I built up the hype too much... or maybe Google just failed to deliver like they used to. The Top 5 speaks to my disappointment with the keynote.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">Temporarily focusing on the positives - there were <i>some</i>&nbsp;good things announced:</span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Google Photos unlimited storage for any photo up to 16MP &amp; video up to 1080p.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Android Pay is coming (eventually). It looks like a clone of Apple Pay; and that's not a bad thing.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Google Maps offline will eventually get business information &amp; turn-by-turn navigation. This is <i>huge</i>&nbsp;boon for anyone travelling abroad.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Lots of goodies for people in developing countries. Not so great for <i>me</i>, but still a positive.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">USB Type C will become the standard for all Android phones in the future.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Udacity is now offering an Android Developer Nanodegree. This is awesome news.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Google's Polymer and Android Studio development platforms have coming updates.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">That's the highlights from my notes.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>May's 30 Day Challenge</b> was to "not be on your phone when spending time with your wife". According to Melissa, I showed a diminishing level of success throughout the month. Intentionally putting down my phone when she was talking didn't cause the world to explode (which was a risk I was taking).</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>June's 30 Day Challenge:</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Eat out ONLY IF with friends.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Subsidary goal:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Try out "meal prepping", which is apparently a whole subculture of its own.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I'm going to leave it at that.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IUEmT885VtM/VWiQAJ2_-DI/AAAAAAABzbs/-EONprsoNpc/s1600/%2523244%2B-%2Bio15-color.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IUEmT885VtM/VWiQAJ2_-DI/AAAAAAABzbs/-EONprsoNpc/s640/%2523244%2B-%2Bio15-color.png" width="640" /></a></div></div></div><br /><div><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Disappointments from Google I/O</span></div><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">5. About one-third of the content "announced" at Google I/O was old news. The "new" Google Photos app is basically just the <i>old</i>&nbsp;Google+ Photos app, without the "+" and with a slightly updated interface. The "new" Android Wear 5.1 demo just showed off what most Android watches already do (not <i>mine</i>&nbsp;yet, but most others already have the update). They talked about Android Auto and Android TV, but didn't say a single <i>new</i>&nbsp;thing about it. There was 10 to 15 minutes dedicated to the history of Google Now before they got to its one new feature. Android M brings almost zero "sexy" new features.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />4. No new hardware. I know this is a </span><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>software</b></span><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"> developer's conference, but most people expected <i>something</i>&nbsp;new for developers to write software <i>for</i>. Chromecast 2. Nexus 5 (2015). Android Player 2.0. A "Nexus" head unit for Android Auto. Any of those would have been great.<br class="kix-line-break" />3.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">No updates to Hangouts. Not even a&nbsp;</span><i style="color: red; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">mention</i><span style="color: red; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">&nbsp;of Hangouts. It is missing some fairly obvious features and is widely lamented by the Google fanboy community. We all hoped for an overhaul. I would have settled for a mention.</span><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><br class="kix-line-break" />2. They tried to sell some pretty blatant lies. Google Photos is "an entirely new product"? The Nest smoke detector was "very successful"? Android TV has been a "great success"? If you tried to make those arguments in a group of nerds, you'd probably be the only one on your side.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Mostly, the lack of things that make an immediate difference in my life. Google Photos aside, everything announced at I/O won't be available for several months to come. I'll wait.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Quote:</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I never thought I'd be so sad about a developer's keynote.”</span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" />- Me, to a coworker -</span></span>
