# Motto: You with Your Long Words and Your Short Difficult Words

The following is a list of words I **like**, but **don't hear much** (and my loose definition of said word, verified by an ~~actual~~ virtual dictionary):

**Forum** - *noun* - a meeting views on a particular issue can be exchanged
People often times meet with a specific agenda in mind, and yet I never hear them refer to the meeting as a forum.

**Gait** - *noun* - manner of walking
This does not mean "swagger". I hate the word "swagger".

**Accost** - *verb* - aggressively address
Mugging without the thievery.

**Dote** - *verb* - show unnecessarily excessive fondness 
I think "dote" sounds old-fashioned to me because it's usually followed by the word "upon".

**Trebuchet** - *noun* - a old throwing machine
Although "trebuchet" is a noun, I like to use it as a verb to refer to specifically to how I throw things.

**Goliath** - *noun* - very large person or thing
I actually love all the words for "large" that rarely get used: "Behemoth", "Colossus", "Gillespie".

**Egregious** - *adverb* - remarkably bad, incredibly outrageous

**Plosive** - *noun* - the stop or pause in exhalation that you must make in order to vocalize certain consonants (such as P or B)
I didn't know what this was until 2 days ago. I included it strictly for the purpose of explaining what it was before it got used in today's Quote.

**Gambit** - *noun* - a clever, tricky, or elaborate plot
I really love this one. It's so rarely used, too.

**Kerfuffle** - *noun* - ado, commotion, the business

**Intermittent** - *adverb* - every so often, marked by periods of "not" 

I'm going to leave the column at that.

No wait, one thing:

I really like Family Guy. I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's low-brow. It's dumb. It's glorious. 

I have a relative that works on the show. She's awesome.

This is Sharon. This picture was taken in California a little under a year ago.

This picture breaks the trend. I don't own a tent yet. When I do it will be probably better than this one.
