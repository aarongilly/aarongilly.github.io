That's usually a codeword for "bad", and in this case... it's not. I'm very in-tune with how my life is and how's been... and for <b>ME</b>, things are going pretty well. I'm happy. Healthy. Strong. In a good spot in my relationship. In good with friends and family (although there's always room for improvement on those last areas).<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Even thought the year isn't over, I'm going to go ahead and do my wrap-up of the "Year of 12 Resolutions", which is what I did instead of 12 individual 30-Day Challenges.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><br /><ol style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;, Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 13.2px;"><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Weigh 240 lbs&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Bench 240 lbs</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Squat 315 lbs</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Deadlift 345 lbs</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Incorporate 3 mile runs into my regular workout routine</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Improve my average macro ratio over previous years</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Average an 80% success rate for Life Tracking</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Slowly build savings by spending less</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Travel out of the contiguous 48 states</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Read 12 books</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">Trend towards a phone screen-on-time of 1 hour per day</li><li style="margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px;">No booze*.

Average of the first 5 measurements I took in 2016 is <b><span style="color: #38761d;">223.7 lbs</span></b>. The average of the last 5 measurements in 2016 (thus far) is <b><span style="color: #38761d;">232.3 lbs</span></b></span>. That means I made it about halfway to my goal. But I'm still not fat. So that's good. Believe it or not that's the least "bro" photo I could find for this. Every other one of the several dozen were too embarrassing.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ulS6CajrAag/WEyKhjyMZwI/AAAAAAACiJ0/IrUJTGT_gicoqEd1C9NrALk4opWEttrGgCLcB/s1600/giphy%2B%25281%2529.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ulS6CajrAag/WEyKhjyMZwI/AAAAAAACiJ0/IrUJTGT_gicoqEd1C9NrALk4opWEttrGgCLcB/s1600/giphy%2B%25281%2529.gif" /></a></div><br /><b>Bench 240</b><br />I started the year with the bench max of somewhere around <span style="color: #38761d;"><b>195 lbs</b></span>. This wasn't my "all-time max". I had previously benched 220 back in 2014. Just 20 minutes ago I went to my HOMEGYM IN THE BASEMENT and set a new PR with&nbsp;<b style="color: #38761d;">235 lbs</b>. That's not QUITE to my 240 goal - but I guess I DO have a couple more weeks to get in one more attempt for the full 240.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rFl-k71xrlM/WEyOzE-I1FI/AAAAAAACiKQ/jviYvcdNd1AqsTfv-drI1L8fMSP9TnOowCLcB/s1600/giphy%2B%25282%2529.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rFl-k71xrlM/WEyOzE-I1FI/AAAAAAACiKQ/jviYvcdNd1AqsTfv-drI1L8fMSP9TnOowCLcB/s1600/giphy%2B%25282%2529.gif" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Squat 315</b><br />I started the year without maxing out on my squats... estimates from the weight/reps I was working out with puts my max likely around&nbsp;<b style="color: #38761d;">245 lbs</b>. Almost two months ago I set a new PR in the squat department of&nbsp;<b style="color: #38761d;">315 lbs</b>. I actually "squat" 345 - problem was upon review of the video - I didn't get anywhere near parallel. I could probably do 315 legit. I'll give it a shot before January 1st.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v9oPpYpb_KA/WEyPyAWtEnI/AAAAAAACiKg/ABkBrLHZAowWt8J0-bPXRYZGljnPCiSigCLcB/s1600/2015-03-30.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="235" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v9oPpYpb_KA/WEyPyAWtEnI/AAAAAAACiKg/ABkBrLHZAowWt8J0-bPXRYZGljnPCiSigCLcB/s400/2015-03-30.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span id="goog_1824125297"></span><b>Deadlift 345</b><br />I also didnt' do anything resembling a deadlift max early in 2016. Estimates put it around&nbsp;<b style="color: #38761d;">280 lbs</b>&nbsp;back then. On many occasions since then I have managed to get&nbsp;<b style="color: #38761d;">315 lbs</b>. I haven't successfully done a deadlift of more than that. I DID just try and fail for the 345 goal I had set for myself. Couldn't get it off the ground. Which is weird given that I sorta squat that much (even though I give myself zero credit).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vFhzkhDNWvk/WEyRZMfc71I/AAAAAAACiKo/E6me8lMlFjos0eync3eG0taR1NlXcaHcACLcB/s1600/Capture.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vFhzkhDNWvk/WEyRZMfc71I/AAAAAAACiKo/E6me8lMlFjos0eync3eG0taR1NlXcaHcACLcB/s400/Capture.PNG" width="390" /></a></div><br /><b>Incorporate 3 Miles Runs Into My Workout</b><br />Yep. Haven't done that yet. Technically I could just run 3 miles one time right before the new year and claim success... assuming I can run 3 miles. I DID start going on bike rides, for what that's worth. I'm still not great at cardio. I DID do a couple 5Ks, though.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ti9QE4s_TJ0/WEySCEI1rUI/AAAAAAACiKs/rbfLwP8mYR8BTN1x8SoKhFitDfjQ7YufQCLcB/s1600/Captur%2B2e.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="151" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ti9QE4s_TJ0/WEySCEI1rUI/AAAAAAACiKs/rbfLwP8mYR8BTN1x8SoKhFitDfjQ7YufQCLcB/s400/Captur%2B2e.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Improve macro ratios</b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nailed it. Carbs down, protein and fats up. That's the trajectory I was going for. Also I managed to achieve my "average 3000 calories" goal that I added halfway through the year. Christmas time might screw this up for me, though. We'll see.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/---nFj4AFuLM/WEySqGkipEI/AAAAAAACiKw/moz2-jhjLGUCiuGd-a0RhoIAndnTj9zRwCLcB/s1600/Capt22ure.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="186" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/---nFj4AFuLM/WEySqGkipEI/AAAAAAACiKw/moz2-jhjLGUCiuGd-a0RhoIAndnTj9zRwCLcB/s400/Capt22ure.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><b>Average 80% success in the Life Tracker</b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nailed it... so far. I have to not screw this up over the holidays, which is a hard time to keep track of foods and stuff. My average lag time between midnight and "tracking" has gone down by almost 10 hours. This is inside baseball, I am aware.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U3Fpu0-Dsao/WE3FYNF6PTI/AAAAAAACiPA/0ZB_4hcNJH8yjqFm-Xu6XAMNpyN-lnRcQCLcB/s1600/IMG_20160817_052622.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U3Fpu0-Dsao/WE3FYNF6PTI/AAAAAAACiPA/0ZB_4hcNJH8yjqFm-Xu6XAMNpyN-lnRcQCLcB/s400/IMG_20160817_052622.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><b>Build up savings</b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I bought a house. There's no such thing as "savings" any more. Okay that's not true, strictly speaking. The intent of this goal for the year was to enable me to buy a house sometime in 2017. Things worked out better for us to go ahead and jump on the homeowner train. So, I guess I haven't really meet the requirements of this goal to the letter... but I met its design intent?</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HYcrfP4w7oo/WEyTRUiW1MI/AAAAAAACiK4/wyGyS2KkPOsKUKUq6XKSXdrGgPwGBeyCwCLcB/s1600/IMG_20160517_140742.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HYcrfP4w7oo/WEyTRUiW1MI/AAAAAAACiK4/wyGyS2KkPOsKUKUq6XKSXdrGgPwGBeyCwCLcB/s400/IMG_20160517_140742.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Travel out of the contiguous 48 states</span></b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">This picture is from Melissa and my cruise/2 year anniversary vacation. Nailed it.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ro4r-1Zr2_Y/WE3GrGj1veI/AAAAAAACiPM/RHzHYGvRr0sVZOaa6x3PkiZ669AXBcgKgCLcB/s1600/mmm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ro4r-1Zr2_Y/WE3GrGj1veI/AAAAAAACiPM/RHzHYGvRr0sVZOaa6x3PkiZ669AXBcgKgCLcB/s400/mmm.jpg" width="298" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><b>Read 12 Books</b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I read... uhh... 3 books? That's probably 2 more than usual. UTTER FAILURE. I suppose I could read 9 books in the next 21 days. That's totally do-able.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KHBkwoNzl60/WE3IGLhXPJI/AAAAAAACiPY/6gbyVZh7X2oHANCob6osiQ4Np6-wp0BCwCKgB/s1600/IMG_20161124_154930.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KHBkwoNzl60/WE3IGLhXPJI/AAAAAAACiPY/6gbyVZh7X2oHANCob6osiQ4Np6-wp0BCwCKgB/s400/IMG_20161124_154930.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><b>Trend screen time towards 1 hour/day</b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span>Pokemon Go really didn't help with this. Technically I have reduced my average daily screen time by about 20 minutes... but it's still north of 3 HOURS a day. That's embarrassing. Side note - the phone in the picture up there is my original Droid. Back in the day, that was considered a "big" phone. It looks like a toy.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QdB7rZhSnr4/WE3IxxeIFBI/AAAAAAACiPg/8MYhv6ce89Aqg8mKMP3SkqEcs8DiN78_wCKgB/s1600/IMG_20161030_143141.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QdB7rZhSnr4/WE3IxxeIFBI/AAAAAAACiPg/8MYhv6ce89Aqg8mKMP3SkqEcs8DiN78_wCKgB/s400/IMG_20161030_143141.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>No Booze*, no soda, no energy drinks</b><br />This goal was set up with the idea that I would allow myself one day of drinking per month. That quickly became "one day of drinking each variety of banned drinks, which don't need to be consolidated to a single day". I honestly did a good job of that for several months. Then summer hit and the whole thing crashed and burned. I have a Red Bull sitting next to this laptop. There's probably a Nutcracker Ale in the forecast for tonight. I gave it a shot.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Surprising Results for the Year</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. I came pretty close to getting most of my lifting goals. I considered them "aggressive" back when I established them. I didn't expect to come as close as I have.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Melissa and I bought a house!<br class="kix-line-break" />3. I accomplished all those lifting goals IN that house!<br class="kix-line-break" />2. I did manage to average 3000 calories/day... but didn't really gain any appreciable weight. My actual average weight over the course of this year has been identical to that of 2015.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. I did genuinely make it like 4 or 5 months on the no booze, no soda thing.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"You might enjoy knowing that tipsy Aaron sang 'Let it Go' out the window on the way home."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Melissa -</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"><br /></span><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Step 1: Order pizza</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Step 2: Obtain pizza</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Step 3: Eat pizza</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Step 4: Regret steps 1-3"</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"></span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Danielle -</span></div>
