<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Just one. That's all it takes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I, Aaron Gillespie, self-proclaimed best-guy alive, along two other best guys alive, started a movie podcast! It's called "We Scene a Movie" - and it's available on a podcast player near you!</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>We three often found ourselves discussing movies when we were together - and the heat coming off our hot takes was too much for we three to bear alone. We realized we'd have to distribute the thermal energy and use podcast listeners as heatsinks. By distributing these hot takes across the greater surface area afforded to us by those people who listen, we are more effectively able to maintain a rate of heat transfer to the ambient environment so as to keep our takes cool and performing nominally.<br /><br />For more strained and extended metaphor jokes, give our podcast a listen!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BScFMvL4BG4/W_B2s0n_--I/AAAAAAADhOY/MyUMxF0McGE5qvRxJ8bMmZcDQigpDhJgQCLcBGAs/s1600/sketch1540653121053.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1600" height="400" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BScFMvL4BG4/W_B2s0n_--I/AAAAAAADhOY/MyUMxF0McGE5qvRxJ8bMmZcDQigpDhJgQCLcBGAs/s400/sketch1540653121053.png" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>We will put up new episodes every-other Sunday. Check in <i>this</i>&nbsp;Sunday, December 2nd (or whenever you want after that, cause that's how podcasts work), for a in-depth review of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. If you can't wait that long, check out either of our two currently-available episodes by following any of the links in my Top 5. In our "Fantastic Predictions" episode one of the guys&nbsp;<b>may</b>&nbsp;have made an <i>excellent</i>&nbsp;prediction (or maybe not, there's only one way to find out)!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small; font-style: italic;">Disclaimer: unlike the Column, our Podcast does contain some PG-13 language - for reasons why, <a href="https://xkcd.com/137/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Ways to Listen to We Scene a Movie</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. <a href="https://pca.st/8og6" target="_blank">Pocketcasts</a> (which is Aaron's preferred app, but you have to pay to use their website)<br class="kix-line-break" />4. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4Sr5ImAboTL0MlRIHMTq5A" target="_blank">Spotify</a></span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">3. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/we-scene-a-movie/id1443036434?mt=2" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a><br class="kix-line-break" />2. <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/Ingels3zp52utd7bdw45dvgxybu" target="_blank">Google Play</a><br class="kix-line-break" />1.
