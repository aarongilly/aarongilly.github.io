<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Writing Wrongs</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">That monitor situation I talked about in my previous post got resolved. I successfully returned the 4K monitor, lessons learned. Earlier this week I procured this new 27 inch, 1440p monitor. It's a high-end version of the middle-tier of hardware. That's the same philosophy I built my computer with, and that has served me well thus far. Rather than getting a low-end high-tier piece of hardware (like I had), where there were corners cut and expenses spared - this new monitor has a great stand, wonderfully saturated colors, and it came with basically every cable that one could possibly use to connect it to stuff.&nbsp;</span>I'm very happy with the new screen and the new dual-screen setup.<br /><br />I've been playing a lot of videogames lately. I partially blame Fallout 4 for being such a great game. I partially blame my work for actually being mentally taxing (causing me to have less excess mental energy). Mostly, though, I blame myself for not being ambitious enough. I don't know exactly&nbsp;<i>what</i>&nbsp;I should be doing - but perhaps something more productive. When Melissa isn't in school we'll hang out &amp; play games and stuff... but in the meantime, maybe...<br /><br />Develop Android apps?<br />Learn to play music? (ha)<br />Make some new humorous videos?<br />Take up jogging?<br />Practice juggling?<br />Competitive sculpting?<br />House flipping?<br />Turtle grooming?<br /><br />Maybe I should cut myself some slack. I work, workout, play basketball, cook, and clean. It's not like I'm bumming around wasting life.<br /><br />A new Hitman is coming out. As I've written about before, I'm a fan. I grew up with the franchise. Enjoyed playing it as a kid. Played the last one. Looking forward to their "episodic releases" this year.<br /><br />I don't have much to write about. This post was made due to an abundance of convenient time moreso than an abundance of inspiration.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The picture to go out on - my new desk setup.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cI2UmLyC3UU/VtCEUJFoyUI/AAAAAAACGbI/Y16LOvXwRso/s1600/IMG_20160222_194849.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cI2UmLyC3UU/VtCEUJFoyUI/AAAAAAACGbI/Y16LOvXwRso/s640/IMG_20160222_194849.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Steves</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
