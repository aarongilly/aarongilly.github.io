I usually just said "hi". This column is a recounting of my trip to Thailand and my engagement to <a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/113805130865865178352" target="_blank">+Melissa Hill</a>.</span></b></div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><div style="font-weight: normal;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">This post will have several pages worth of information, pictures, and one video. To keep the length of this post somewhat manageable, though, I'm going to employ my favorite space-saving technique:.</span></span></span></div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"><br /></span><br /><ul><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"><li><b style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Trip Out</b><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">:</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I flew from Kansas City to Los Angeles, to Tokyo, to Bangkok.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I flew Delta. I will probably use them from now on if I have the option.</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">More about Delta will follow in my next column (I already have it planned)</span></li></ul><li>I stayed up the night before my initial flight at 6am to try to nip jetlag in the bud.</li><ul><li>I couldn't sleep on the plane due to being 6'8" to 6'9" and generally giddiness.</li><li>I had been awake for ~43 hours straight when I reached Japan. I took a sleeping pill when my plane was about to board.</li><li>My plane was delayed. 3 hours. I fell asleep on a bench.</li><li>I woke up as my plane was boarding - didn't alert Melissa I did, in fact, wake up.</li></ul><li>I arrived in Bangkok around 3am (as opposed to the 11:30pm that was supposed to be)</li><ul><li>Total transit time: Around 36 hours.</li></ul><li>Somehow I missed Melissa, who was waiting for me at my gate.</li><ul><li>I couldn't get a password for the WiFi.</li><li>Melissa thought I was still asleep in Japan.</li><li>I walked around BKK airport for an hour and fifteen minutes without any means to contact anyone before we ran across each other.</li></ul><li>We hopped in a Taxi. I was, in a word, zonked.</li></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>Initial Impressions:</b></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Melissa's place</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Really nice, actually. It was like a really good dorm room. She lives in an apartment without a roommate in Salaya, Thailand.</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Mahidol University</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Univeristy at which Melissa works, based out of Salaya, is also really nice.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The campus was huge. Hard to compare it to KU, but it seemed to be of the same approximate size.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Wikipedia just told me they have 26 thousand students. KU has 29 thousand. Close!</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bangkok</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bangkok was weirdly exactly like I expected and nothing at all like I expected.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">There are hundreds of skyscrapers littered throughout the landscape... but they are not all congregated in any one main area. You have vast expanses of small buildings, slums, parks, rivers, and favelas in between the huge, tall buildings. But no matter which way you look, you see sky scrappers in the distance.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The heat was bad, but not "the worst thing I've ever experienced" like I was expecting.&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Melissa said she was intentionally making it seem worse than it really was so I would be prepared</span><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">There were monks walking around, but no elephants. I was only half disappointed.</span></span></li></ul></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>Temples:</b></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Grand Palace</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Grand Palace is huge. Huge and golden.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I've been to several big churches in the United States - but nothing I've ever seen even begins to compare to the Grand Palace. It's... astonishing.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">There were a seemingly unending amount of shrines, buildings, artwork, and people.</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The place was extremely dense with tourists. </span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was really hot and bright.</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Wat Po</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Although not as huge as the Grand Palace - still huge.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Less vertical. Less dense in general.</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">This included less people - which I loved.</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Full of art and history and golden and rock statues of monks, little Buddhas, and the largest Buddha in Thailand.</span></span></li><ul><li>32 feet tall. 141 feet long. (he's laying on his side)</li></ul></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">There were many other temples we could have/were going to see; but that was the hottest day of the trip. This was exacerbated by the fact that we had to wear long pants to enter some of the temples.&nbsp;</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>Malls:</b></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Being American, I enjoyed the malls quite a lot. There are 4 malls that are more or less in a line near the middle of Bangkok in Siam Square.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The malls decreased in "niceness" and "hugeness" as you went down the line from East to West.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The malls were the best example of just how much influence American culture has in other countries.&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was sitting in the food court across from a Subway, Auntie Annes, Hagaan Daz, KFC, and a Burger King. The menus weren't quite the same - but everything was in English. You had to really look to find any Thai.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The largest mall, Siam Paragon, is 7 stories tall and houses hundreds of stores.</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">American stores like H&amp;M, The Gap, Forever 21, and probably others that I don't even know about.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Other stores of note: Samsung, Sony, Ferarri (with actual cars), Prada, Versache, </span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I realize it was largely targeted at foreigners ("Farang" as they said), but it was still quite surprising.</span></li></ul></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>Beaches:</b></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The natural beauty of the jungles and beaches of Thailand cannot begin to be described in words. I would pit the beaches at the Similan and Surin Marine National Parks against any beach anywhere. <i>Anywhere</i>.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The sand was almost purely white and ultrafine. Individual grains of sand were impossible to see. It was like walking on powder. It was hard to tell where the sand ended and the water began.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The water was clear and full of coral and fish. Snorkeling there was unreal.</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I <i>hated</i> snorkeling at first. After my brain realized I wasn't drowning, though, it was awesome. Tandem snorkeling with Melissa is an experience I'll never forget.</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Probably the most impressive and great thing about the beaches was just how empty they were. There were hundreds and hundreds of feet of beach and less than 100 people there. You'll notice in the pictures later there are hardly any other people in the background. Try doing that in Florida.</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>Overall Impressions of the People in Thailand:</b>&nbsp;</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Thais are unanimously nice and courteous. They mind their own business and leave you be.</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">This wasn't just something I realized as an afterthought - this was something that shocked me every day I was there.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I wish America was halfway near that laid back.</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">People in Thailand are shorter in general. When we were riding one of the many forms of public transportation we used, Melissa was often (but not always) the second tallest person person or close to being the second tallest person on board. Having said that - they also react hilariously to tall people. They were never rude about it - but I could definitely tell they don't routinely see people who can't stand up on their buses. &nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Speaking of public transit - it is used by normal people over there. Here (at least where I live) it seems like the bus stop is frequented only by the sketchiest of individual. I would pick bus stops in Thailand over Kansas City 100 days out of 100.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Ladyboys exist.</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><b>Trip back:</b></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The trip back was slightly shorter than the trip there. Probably 32 hours.&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">It seemed much shorter, though, because I was travelling with the sun. I left Thailand and arrived in America on the same day, technically.</span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The landing in Japan was rough. Like, "I let out a bit of a yelp and grabbed the seat in front of me with white knuckles" rough.</span></span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">They warned us about high winds ahead of time. They weren't joking.</span></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I figured out the seats on the international flights CAN be sleepable if I sat a certain way.</span></span></li></ul></span></ul></div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"></span><div dir="ltr" style="font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></span></div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.5073363590054214"><div dir="ltr" style="font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">The other thing I wanted to write about is the biggest thing that happened during the whole trip, if not the biggest thing that has ever happened in my life:&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I got engaged.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">During the middle day of the trip, the 2nd of the three days we spent in the jungles and the beaches, I used the natural beauty of the landscape as the setting for the biggest question you ever get to ask anyone... Will you marry me?</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">She said yes.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">(Check the quote at the end of this column for the actual transcript... I left out the long, stunned silence that occurred first.)</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span>I manged to find a secluded section of the beach with a fantastic view. It was in the corner, near a group of interesting rocks. While she was taking pictures and enjoying the scenery, I was setting up a video camera and getting the ring out from it's hiding spot deep within our bag. The whole thing is on video.<br /><br />Afterwards, we took several photos. Both on the beach, and later at the Kuraburi resort. This photo was taken were I asked her.<br /><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SiZ82jwWy-g/UWzn_GfP0uI/AAAAAAAAuKw/zP-KlDDetsw/s1600/Yay.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SiZ82jwWy-g/UWzn_GfP0uI/AAAAAAAAuKw/zP-KlDDetsw/s640/Yay.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">People in Thailand apparently love jump photos.
