<b id="internal-source-marker_0.13670979719609022"><span style="color: #e69138; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Motto: Bwhaaaaaaaaaam</span><br /><span style="color: #e69138; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">About the motto - I'm watching Inception. So you might have to take this entire post with a grain of salt. </span></b><br /><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></b><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Maybe a brick of salt.</span></b><br /><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have had a surge of productive energy since the end of school. Something about not having homework. Not having homework assignments gnawing at the back of my mind. Not having a cosntant study monkey on my back. Not having any of those things really puts me in a different mindset. Before, free time was spent "actively relaxing", if such a thing exists. Now that there is no homework. I am doing things with my free time. All those things I wished I had time for during school.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I did some research about cell phone companies. Verizon is killing the unlimited data. The grandfathered in plans from older Verizon contracts. From even older Alltel contracts. I found out that pre-paid phone plans exist right now that offer unlimited text, talk, and data for $50/month... <i>and you can bring in any unlocked GSM phone you want. </i>That means, the unlocked Galaxy Nexus that Google is offering from their Play Store for $400 and pay $50/month for as long or as short as you want. That is much cheaper than the $200 subsidized version at Verizon with $100/month plans. It pays for itself after 4 months of usage and then saves you $50 for every year thereafter.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The other thing I wanted to talk about briefly was my recent Zen moment with Google Plus. The number of friends I have now that actively use Google Plus is growing. It has become a more legitimate option as time has passed and I will continue to back it fully. It truly is what sharing online <b>SHOULD </b>be like. Facebook is mindless chatter. Google Plus is full of things I actually <i>care</i> about. </span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last two things:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">1. I just finished <a href="http://inception.davepedu.com/">Inception</a>. I now fully subscribe to the interpretation that he was asleep still.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2. My new phone background (thanks to my lovely girlfriend) is AWESOME:</span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1OmpTOGLzBI/T7bBiyLbHgI/AAAAAAAAC1g/qoW8XZTd1AA/s1600/Screenshot_2012-05-17-23-29-44.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1OmpTOGLzBI/T7bBiyLbHgI/AAAAAAAAC1g/qoW8XZTd1AA/s320/Screenshot_2012-05-17-23-29-44.png" width="180" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">The avengers was AWESOME.</div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Top 5: True realizations I had during my Zen moment</span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">5.&nbsp;All of the content I see on Google+ is <i>relevant</i>. I care about everything I see because everything I see was intended for me to look at. This is a stark contrast to Twitter and Facebook where every post is meant for everyone (for the most part). I feel sharing on those networks is like trying to shout something in a loud concert hall. most of what you see wasn't <i>really </i>meant for you.</span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">4.&nbsp;The messenger app for Android and iPhone does have a purpose. When trying to organize a group meetup, there really is no smarter way to do it. I want to use and explore this feature more- but I really love the idea. Google+ is way more than just a social network. They came late to the game and had a few misses along the way, but they really knocked it out of the park when they got it right.</span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">3.&nbsp;Sharing exactly what you want with exactly who you want to share it with is a much better system than Twitter and Facebook's approach. Seriously. Much much better. Having said that, "Public" posts are important every once in a while. People think Google+ isn't used because the selective share feature works so well.</span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;The integration with Android is really remarkable. Android has passed the iPhone in terms of successfully integrating a cohesive system (this is beyond Google+, but it is what made me fully realize it)</span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;Google+ hangouts are fun. They go beyond "Skyping" and can be used for a <i>lot</i> more than video calls. Google Docs editing. Youtube watch parties. Group hangouts. Screen sharing. All of which can be accomplished from any Android/iPhone. Hangouts are a feature I have explored way too little.</span><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="color: #cc0000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span><br /><span style="color: #6aa84f; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: #6aa84f; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">"You could call it Locii... multiple locust"</span><br /><span style="color: #6aa84f; font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Joe Sliter's (technically wrong) suggestion for Jon's future dog's name.&nbsp;-</span>
