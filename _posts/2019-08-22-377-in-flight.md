The point of this post is to see if I can write a post from this laptop I'm writing on. Assuming this comes out alright, I don't think I have really any reservations about just making the switch.

## GitHub vs Blogger

Blogger shows a "what you see is sort of what you get" editor interface. GitHub has a plaintext interface with some nice Markdown. I'm self-aware enough that I am making the change mostly because I wanted a change. Uh oh I just realized this interface doesn't check spelling. UH OH. I could probably write these in Carot and upload them?

# Top 5: Projects I've got in Flight
