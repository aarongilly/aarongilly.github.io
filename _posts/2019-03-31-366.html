<div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: <a href="https://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/proof-google-is-god/" target="_blank">Google is God</a></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">There's a Google product you should know about; it's called <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout" target="_blank">Google Takeout</a>. It&nbsp;</span>is <b>not </b>a food service, so don't get excited. Don't make the same joke that literally 5 people I've told about this have made.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Google Takeout is a service that allows you to <i>take out</i>&nbsp;your data from Google - in theory so that you could go to some other service and keep your data. In reality, it's probably best just for seeing an aggregate list of everything they have of yours and about you. I requested an archive of everything they had associated with my account, leaving out Google Drive<i> (because I have 500GB+ in the cloud &amp; don't need them to send me my own files back to me)</i>. Then I spent a week's worth of free time going through it all &amp; taking 5 full pages of notes about what I found. This post is primarily the contents of those notes. Now, before we get into that.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I am pro-Google. I use or have used almost every one of their publicly-offered services Google is astounding. I was a Google Plus die-hard well beyond anyone reasonably should have been. I'm writing this from a desk with a little "Google" neon lamp on it... on a Google-developed browser... using Blogger. I think Google is a great and wonderful company that makes the world a better place. Google Takeout even re-instills my faith that the company is still living to their erstwhile motto: "Don't be evil". A company that goes through this much effort to enable you to not only see what they know about you, but also help you to take your business elsewhere... I think that's pretty great.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">All that said...</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Google is <i><b>terrifying</b></i>.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I know better than the average person off the street what Google <i>probably</i>&nbsp;had on me. I'm technically minded. I'm an engineer. I write code for work and for fun. I have a Life Tracker, for God's sake... and yet I was <u>still</u>&nbsp;shocked and awed by the immensity of it all.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">262 gigabytes&nbsp;</span></b></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">148,172 files</span></b></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">4,552 folders</span></b></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Granted, a large proportion of those numbers (230, 111974, &amp; 3903, respectively) fall to my Google Photos export. Take out Google Photos and the dataset is still 31.6GB, 36,196 files, in 647 folders.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">In there, are many things you'd expect to find:&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"></div><ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">all my photos from Google Photos&nbsp;</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>54,035 photos &amp; 57,939 metadata files</li><li>including my photos and photos from others I've added to my collection</li><li>Metadata including geographic coordinates, photo views, and any comments associated with them</li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">all my notes from Google Keep&nbsp;</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>855 notes &amp; 279 attached media files</li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">all my emails from Gmail&nbsp;</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>one 2.5GB lumped text file</li><li>weirdly not sorted in any order I can figure out</li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">all my chats from Hangouts&nbsp;</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>one 328MB, 10,277,395 line .json file</li><li>weirdly, chat is also in the Gmail file... same chats in both, different format</li><li>this includes both sides of the conversation, images are also included in separate files - but only the ones I sent, not the ones I received</li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">all the details for my contacts</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>one 60KB .vcf file &amp; associated photos</li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">all my purchases made through Google Express</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>including what I bought, for how much, where it was delivered, how I paid</li></ul><li><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">every exercise session I ever logged with Google Fit</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">including what I did, when I did it, where I did it, and how far I traveled during</span></li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">my entire search history&nbsp;</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>split out by product (Search, developers, drive, analytics, apps, cloud, news, images, inbox, videos, maps, play store, and more)</li></ul><li><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">the content of every Blogger post I've ever made</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">this sentence will be in there after I hit "Publish"</span></li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">my browser history*</li><ul style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><li>one 10MB .json file</li></ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">my location history, which I'll expand on in a bit</li><ul><li style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I knew something had to power the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb" target="_blank">Google Timeline</a></li></ul></ul><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i>*For some reason my browser history is incomplete.

If you have a gmail account. If you use any Google Apps and services (which, you do) they have a similar aggregation available for you. I think it's worth taking a look into. They really don't make it hard.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Do I have a problem with them having this much data on me? Well, not really. They provide a great benefit to me in my life, but also the world. They provide services free of charge, in exchange for information about us so they can show relevant advertisements. To me, that's a very worthwhile trade. I wouldn't be nearly as happy or comfortable in my everyday life if Google didn't exist. Neither would you.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Also - Google is </span><i style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">hardly </i><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">the only tech company that has a treasure trove of data about each of us, yet (so far as I know) they </span><i style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">are</i><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;the only one that's willing to share what they have with you this easily. I'm sure Facebook and Amazon have an </span><b style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">immense</b><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp;amount of information about each of us, but they don't give me the same utility that Google does. I pay Amazon for the privileged&nbsp;of using their Prime benefits. Facebook is a great social networking platform for those who want to use it that way... to me it provide negative utility - but that's a different story.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">So that's Google Takeout. Thus ends my week of obsession with it. Time to move on to other things.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Quick edit: for a quicker look at things - check out&nbsp;<a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity</a></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I'll include this on this post, because I was interested. The data Google sent back to me was sent already broken out into folders by product. Each product may have a different file type from any other product. Prevalent file types were .mp3 for audio, regular .jpg or .png for pictures, calendar and contact files were their standard filetypees, .JSON for most datasets, .CSV was next most popular dataset type, followed by .XML, then niche filetypes (eg. ".MBOX", ".GOO", ".TCX"). Keep notes were kept in an HTML file that looked exactly like the note on the app. Photos were organized in folders by album title, if photos weren't in albums then albums were auto-generated using the date of the day they were taken. My 111,974 files were split into 3,903 folders.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Services I Recommend YOU Getting an Archive Of</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.&nbsp;Photos - if you don't actually have your photos on your computer, you're one account loss away from losing all those memories.<br class="kix-line-break" />4.&nbsp;Hangouts - if you used it, it's nice to have a searchable copy of your conversation history for posterity.
