<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Do You Have Any Apple Fritters?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I read an article (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/200905/if-you-want-succeed-don-t-tell-anyone" target="_blank">like this one</a>) about a psychology study in which the takeaway was: telling somebody you were going to achieve a goal, made you less likely to achieve that goal. I thought "I should stop telling people I'm going to do things before I do them!" Then I promptly pulled open my messaging app and typed a message to my wife saying:&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>"I think I'm going to stop telling you about things I want to do to better myself befo"</i>...</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Then I realized the irony of the message, and pressed 'delete' instead of 'send'.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I say it here because I thought it was funny.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">You ever make a table like this?</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FKCIPpuo1uU/XGhL_JbKu9I/AAAAAAADp5E/L4oE-tRMAQ4t9UEXgXUxC5lzUUVBtnjeACLcBGAs/s1600/ink%2B%25281%2529.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="747" data-original-width="663" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FKCIPpuo1uU/XGhL_JbKu9I/AAAAAAADp5E/L4oE-tRMAQ4t9UEXgXUxC5lzUUVBtnjeACLcBGAs/s640/ink%2B%25281%2529.png" width="568" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you haven't, maybe think about doing it.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Or don't. I expected it to be more enlightening than it was.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>I have a Podcast. It's got&nbsp;<a href="https://we-scene-a-movie.pinecast.co/" target="_blank">a website</a>&nbsp;in case you're not interested in Podcast apps... it's nothing fancy. Just a thing we do for fun.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Things I Learned About Communication at Work</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. ... I only have 4 points to make. This is me copping out.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. It is incredibly rare to communicate too much or too clearly.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />3. Pay attention to what means of communication works best for given situations. Use those for similar situations. A lot of times a 20 minute chat can be done in a 3 minute phone call... and other times a 3 minute phone call can be done in a 5 second chat.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. The word "but" is almost never worth saying. "And" works in it's place AND doesn't make it sound like you weren't lying about whatever you said before it.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Don't say "just" in an email. Stuff like "I just wanted to say..." makes it sound like you're not worth their time.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Any flat surfaces around, he will stack [stuff] on.
