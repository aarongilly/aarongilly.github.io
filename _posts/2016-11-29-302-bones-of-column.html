<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Hey Google, tell me about my day</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm just going to post this as is - everything in italics is how my Posts start, before I fill them out with words.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i><br /></i></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>Google Home. It's really really cool and shows a lot of potential. My wife was originally pretty skeptical, but she's come around on it quickly.</i></span><br /><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Black Mirror is a crazy, messed up, wonderful show. The Entire History of you is a perfect example episode - take a conceptual future, which is conceivably possible within my lifetime (and, realistically, I think very close to the direction we're heading) and show how or why we need to be responsible with it - because technology enables us to do so many great things while giving us a long enough rope to tie into a noose. Also how it explores the themes of constantly dwelling in the past or otherwise not being in the moment. About how you can sit and stew on something for forever, rather than dealing with it moving on with your life. Talk about the Google Home listening to each episode, too.</span></i><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i><br /></i></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>Life is good.</i></span><br /><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Facts vs. Truth &amp; the editorialization of fact-based reporting by those with agendas. Talk about Ken Bone and how he's not perfect, but how he is not deserving of the skewering he got immediately following his surge of popularity. This isn't at all my only opinions on the subject, but it's a decent representation that's not tied politics (which I will always stay away from on this blog).</span></i><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">That's what the Column looks like before I flesh it out. Oh and here's a photo:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GKf4xnnCVyU/WD5Kha1lPNI/AAAAAAAChKo/lFgqkH9B6U4a2VM4IfyjAyzXrr0Jc7lJgCKgB/s1600/IMG_20161124_182514.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GKf4xnnCVyU/WD5Kha1lPNI/AAAAAAAChKo/lFgqkH9B6U4a2VM4IfyjAyzXrr0Jc7lJgCKgB/s640/IMG_20161124_182514.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The word was "Crackers".</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 10: Favorite TV Comedies</span><br /><span style="color: red;">10.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">Family Guy</span><br /><span style="color: red;">9.
