<div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: I'm the Guy in the Suit</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This post was written more for me than usual. Proceed with caution and/or boredom.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most of my writing lately has funneled into the MCU Feature. I didn't make that a link, because what's on this site doesn't reflect the current state of the Feature. I don't like Blogger's text editor for advanced formatting. I want my Features to be formatted nicely, sort of a showcase of "I <i>could</i>&nbsp;be doing <i>this</i>&nbsp;every time". So I'm writing the Feature elsewhere, and will hopefully figure out a way to display it on this site that maintains my formatting.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Hopefully.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">It's October. <a href="http://www.aarongilly.com/2014/11/215-lawrence-library-october-30-day.html">Traditionally, October has been my bulk month</a>, but I am taking bulk off this year for a couple of reasons:</span><br /><br /><ol><li>I don't have access to a gym with a proper squat rack or bench press. Bulking without lifting heavy is just called "getting fat". So I'm not doing that.</li><li>I am in two basketball leagues, playing at least two games a week. It's come to my attention that I could use some cardio love. Bulking runs counter to that end.</li></ol></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The 30 Day Challenge for this month will instead be "<b>break a sweat 5 days a week</b>". That should be nice and easy without being <i>too</i>&nbsp;nice and easy. I very badly need to get back on top of my health game. So this covers that.<br /><br />In my writing of the MCU Feature, I've been rewatching the series. I still pull out new things from these movies... not saying they are super deep or anything - I'm just saying that almost every movie usually has a few things you can't pick up without repeated viewings. I've fully changed my opinion about a few details from these movies because I've picked up new things this time around.<br /><br />I babysit my niece and nephew. Kids are getting less scary... but that brings them from "the scariest thing I can think of" levels to "less scary than 'The Ring', but still way up there" levels.<br /><br />Proof I have the best friends:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vELwc1C3AOg/VhNZtC_ILII/AAAAAAAB-ts/TsosfP5C1s0/s1600/267%2B-%2BBest%2Bfriends.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vELwc1C3AOg/VhNZtC_ILII/AAAAAAAB-ts/TsosfP5C1s0/s640/267%2B-%2BBest%2Bfriends.png" width="238" /></a></div><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Things that Happened in 2008</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. Christopher Nolan's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)">The Dark Knight</a>" comes out. It blows away everyone's expectations, but doesn't earn the top-scoring "superhero movie" spot on this list.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. I switched majors from Film Studies to (journalism, then computer science, then computer engineering, then...) Electrical Engineering<br class="kix-line-break" />3.
