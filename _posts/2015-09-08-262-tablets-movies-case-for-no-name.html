<div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Cross another off the movie bucket list</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I want a tablet, but...</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Tablets are the most fun pieces of computing tech out there - even if they may be the least <i>useful.</i>&nbsp;Their use IS "fun". They are THE BEST general browsing experience you can find. If you have tons of time to kill and nothing to do, nothing beats a tablet. They provide a more compelling user experience than phones. They aren't as cumbersome as laptops. They are portable in ways that televisions and videogame consoles can't be. They are the <b>perfect </b>form factor.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">... but they <i>suck</i>&nbsp;for input-intensive applications (which is a basic requirement for most "productive" uses of technology). They aren't portable enough to replace a phone. They usually aren't capable enough to replace your computer. Tablets are perfect&nbsp;in theory... In reality, though, their usage case sits in a narrow window.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I will say, though, tablets are PERFECT for kids. Long-ish battery life. More games than you could ever play. Movies and music on the go. Your own little world. Who cares if it's a pain to manage email on one? I wish I had a Nexus 7 when I was ten years old. That would have rocked.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Segways were a terrible invention... And this is a terrible segway.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I like movies -</span>&nbsp;moreso than I think most people realize. (I <i>did </i>major in film for a bit.) I'm working on a bucket list of movies I need to watch. If you have suggestions for this list, let me know:</div><ul><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Star Wars (all - I'm currently rectifying this huge hole in my movie history)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Back to the Future (all)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The Godfather (all)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Goodfellas</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Scarface (there's a theme here)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Alien</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Total Recall (the original one)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">For some reason - I really want to watch GATTACCA</span></li></ul><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Speaking of movies - I wish Hollywood didn't use established actors for every big-production they make. I don't like going to see newest Tom Cruise movie where Tom Cruise plays the character you'll later refer to as "Tom Cruise's character". You never learned the character's name because it wasn't important. It was Tom Cruise. That's just not the way stories should be told. I wish actors and characters were married more heavily. Big name celebrities shouldn't be a thing. If you star in Guardians of the Galaxy, you shouldn't <i>also</i>&nbsp;be the guy in Jurassic World <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=release+date+of+Guardians+of+the+Galaxy+-+release+date+of+Jurassic+World">10 months and 11 days</a> later... even if I love Chris Pratt just as much as everyone else.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><u>The following contains "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" spoilers. Fair warning.</u></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo introduced Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. She absolutely dominated the screen. I bought into her character 100%, because her performance was great and also it wasn't marred by 4 other roles I recognized her from. She was new. She was fresh. I believed her <i>character</i>.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In that same movie, however, we see a great example of what </span><b>not</b>&nbsp;to do. We follow around the protagonist (played by Daniel Craig) while he investigates this murder than happened a long time ago. During this investigation, we are&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;">introduced to a whole host of no-name side characters... and Stellan Skarsgård. Immediately I thought to myself "Oh, well, he did it. He's the famous guy."&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I was right.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">He was obviously the bad guy because he was the only celebrity (other than the protagonist) that I recognized immediately. For a mystery/thriller, that's a pretty big misstep to make. Imagine if Stellan Skasg</span>ård's character (see, I never learned his name) was played by a nobody? Then each person you met had an equal chance of being the murderer. Giving a character to a well-established actor immediately makes you aware that that character is important... which <i>can</i>&nbsp;be a good thing, but is usually better accomplished naturally through plot development.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Besides, admit you want more of this from your movies:</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WeE5TfNod4A/Ve-uT1kAqPI/AAAAAAAB8W0/yfgZtebE7aE/s1600/Girl%2Bwith%2Bthe%2BDragon%2BTattoo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WeE5TfNod4A/Ve-uT1kAqPI/AAAAAAAB8W0/yfgZtebE7aE/s640/Girl%2Bwith%2Bthe%2BDragon%2BTattoo.jpg" width="640"></a></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">That picture is one of my almost 400 movie-themed desktop wallpapers.
