<div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Writing for Me, by Me</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Melissa is going back to grad school, she's taking her Mac Air &amp; iPad with her &amp; utilizing Microsoft OneNote. While she was setting up her notetaking environment, I started thinking about how I would architect my "idealized system for handling graduate school". Fair warning, this is a bit of an epic.<br /><br />A system for succeeding in higher education is defined in several broad categories:</div><ol><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>What would I physically bring with me to class?</b></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>How would I take notes that are relevant immediately and in the future?</b></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>How do I manage time &amp; tasks?</b></span></li></ol><div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Answering these questions is the purpose of this Column. I'm going to do so both "in general" and given my specific (more interesting to me, but less interesting in general) case.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>1. What would I physically bring with me to class?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Obviously I would bring with me a bag. I'd probably just keep my current messenger bag for simplicity sake. Anything could work.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In all cases I can imagine, you'd need a electronic device, be it for accessing the internet for email, looking at course content, performing homework, and/or taking notes. Exactly <i>which</i>&nbsp;electronic device you should bring is a difficult question. You've got tons of options, but they all pretty well fall into the laptop category, the tablet category, or somewhere in between. Which one is right for you?</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If your notes are mostly text-based, a regular old laptop is perfect. If your notes are heavily graphical, you'll probably want a tablet. If you need both, it's best to get something that handles both use cases reasonably well. Text-based notes with graphical elements can be achieved on tablets (with an associated physical keyboard) or on laptops with touch screens. I prefer the tablet with keyboard method, as drawing something with your pointer finger on a screen held up by a hinge just isn't that great of an experience.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">When it comes to tablets, most people probably use the de facto iPad as their go-to. If not that, I suspect you'd see a lot of iPad Minis. Less often, you may find an Android tablet or a Microsoft-based tablet (such as their Surface Pro).</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I think my <i>ideal </i>electronic companion for school (or work while travelling) would be a tablet with a detachable keyboard, sized at about 12 inches. The dimensions should be roughly the same as a typical spiral-bound notebook. I checked, my Chromebook is the right depth, but about 1.5 inches too wide. I wish it were narrower... and the screen came off... and it were touch screen. Maybe something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTC-Nexus-9-Keyboard-Folio/dp/B00MNOQ96A/">Nexus 9&nbsp;+ Folio Case</a> would be the right fit for me, maybe not.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you aren't taking notes digitally, you'll probably want a notebook with some writing utensils. I prefer at least three pens of varying colors. I find color to be a helpful added dimension in notetaking.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Bring that stuff, any specialty items you are required to have for classes requiring them, and your normal EDC. If your normal EDC has a gun in it, consider <i>not</i> bring that.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Personally - I <i>may</i>&nbsp;be travelling to my eventual university... or I might try some of the newer &amp; innovative online graduate degrees. Computer Science is a particularly good field for such a program. Amongst the schools I'm considering is at least one program that utilizes online classes. So I might not end up even bringing <i>pants</i>&nbsp;with me to school. Time will tell.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><b>2. How would I take notes that are relevant immediately and in the future?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">In terms of dead-horse topics, my wife will tell you that this one is in contention for the heavyweight champion belt. This is (probably) the deadest of the horses I routinely beat.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><a href="http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/search?q=notetaking">Electronic notetaking paradise, the never ending search</a>.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Before I get started, I should give old-fashioned "paper notebook" notetaking some credit. It's what I've done literally my entire academic life. Each class has a notebook, each notebook is filled with pages of notes, doodles, and non-sequiturs. The problem, though, is that those notes don't remain relevant in the future. I have written more notes than I ever care to go through, but if I ever wanted to find one thing from them - that's exactly what I'd have to do. Pull out each notebook from the shelf I never access and look through them page by page. Physical notetaking just doesn't appeal to me as a "compendium of knowledge" sort of thing. While I do admit it's probably better for digesting the information (writing is better than typing for translating text into actual learning), it is not a viable resource for rediscovery or long-term consumption.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Also before I continue into my short rant about the sad state of notetaking software, let me take another aside - the column was originally going to be about just this next point.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"The Cloud" vs. Local Resources - as written in my Moleskine</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i><br /></i></span></div><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The Google fanatic in me wants to use web services for everything. I picture a&nbsp;Utopian&nbsp;life in the&nbsp;cloud, where all my content and tools are ubiquitously and immediately available on any device with a web connection. Configuration and system maintenance are never really needed. You fire up your computer, phone, chromebook, or whatever &amp; pick up right where you left off.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The old-fashioned computer geek in me wants to build out "the" system. A single machine on which you can run anything you install and you're nest is built just right. You carved your own empire out of the stone, every decision deliberate and all details put to your desire. When you are in your chair, at your battlestation, you are limitless with what you can accomplish. Your CPU is more than enough engine to take you anywhere you want to go, and you're the engineer.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">...but your computer could crash, your OS could corrupt, you could get a virus, it could get stolen or destroyed. No matter what, you're eventually going to upgrade to something else. Also, what about those times where you want to do work, but aren't at your desk? What about when you're out and about and you need access to your documents? Your tricked-out computational kingdom is great - but it's a single resource at a single location and serves a single point of failure.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">On the other hand, is "the cloud" really all that great? You can't really (yet) do any serious video editing, photo or music production, or development. Sure, having your toolkit with you at all times is great - but is that worth shrinking your set of tools? Also, what tools you do have are subject to change without notification, consent, or your control. You may put all of your eggs in one, beautiful basket just to find someday that your basket has changed into something you didn't like - or worse yet - it's not even in the tree of "supported products" by whatever 3rd party owns it. Who's to say their company and their service has any longer lifespan than your own computer? People who put tons of work &amp; time into Google Reader might warn you not to get too invested in a product you can't prevent from destruction.</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The Cloud and Local Resources share similar-yet-opposite advantages and disadvantages:</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>"The Cloud"</b></span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Advantages:</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Ubiquitous access</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Hardware failure isn't likely to kill your projects &amp; content</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Generally gets better &amp; faster over time&nbsp;</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Disadvantages:</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; You need an internet connection</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; What services you use may die on you</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Security threat: Hackers</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Local Resources</b></span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Advantages:</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Permanent access, so long as your computer runs it won't go away</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Total control</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Powerful applications - video, photo, code, &amp; music production</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Disadvantages:</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; You need to be at <u>your</u> computer</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; What hardware you use may die on you</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&gt; Security threat: Viruses</span></i></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">You can see how that was originally going to be its own Column. But why write more than one ultra-long piece about this something so similar in theme?</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">So - why bring that up at all?</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>The ultimate conclusion from the Moleskine entry is that you just have to decide whether you're going to use web services or a local program to accomplish tasks on a case-by-case basis. Some cases are simple: who wants a local email client anymore? Video editing is clearly something that works better locally. Notetaking, though, is kind of in an in-between state. You want access to your notes everywhere, but you'll also want the horsepower and staying power of a local client. You want your notes to be permanent - so that makes cloud solutions less appealing (two separate cloud-based notetaking platforms I've used in the past are no longer a thing - I'm very glad I never put much stock in either). You <i>also</i>&nbsp;want your notes to be available when you need them - i.e. <i>on your phone</i>.<br /><br />There are essentially two "serious" notetaking solutions available right now: <a href="https://www.onenote.com/">Microsoft OneNote</a> and <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote's namesake product</a>. There are other ways to skin a cat, though. You could just have a folder on your computer with tons of text documents, or word documents. You could back up that folder in Dropbox or Google Drive. Google Drive has the added benefit of including a native document/spreadsheet editor that's surprisingly capable. All in all, it boils down to three real ways to do stuff... and each is imperfect. I have refined/expanded my list of "required features" in recent years. Here's an updated version of the table from <a href="http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/2014/04/166-attack-mode.html">Column #166</a>:<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Xap5zCCWs0/Vd0z2fGp-sI/AAAAAAAB7Y8/Hkr6Eu_uUa4/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-08-25%2Bat%2B10.33.57%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Xap5zCCWs0/Vd0z2fGp-sI/AAAAAAAB7Y8/Hkr6Eu_uUa4/s1600/Screenshot%2B2015-08-25%2Bat%2B10.33.57%2BPM.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="font-weight: normal;">* - although it hardly counts</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">** - if you pay for it</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">*** - if you use Outlook, so this shouldn't be here at all, really</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">All of the listed solutions technically let you store notes locally &amp; on the cloud, but OneNote is more locally focused, Evernote is more cloud focused, and Drive is both and neither.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Given the current state of affairs, I think the best overall product for notetaking is Microsoft OneNote... but I don't use it in my personal life because Microsoft wants you to use your OneDrive &amp; Outlook.com email account, neither of which I have any interest in. If it were just slightly better, I'd suck it up and make a new "outlook" account, or whatever they are calling it nowadays. I use Google Drive plus LastPass to cover the password-protected usage case (which is critical for my needs).</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Realistically - I'd guess the <i>best</i>&nbsp;way to take digital notes right now is to use something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Intel-Core-Windows/dp/B00KHR4T8U">Microsoft Surface Pro 3 + OneNote</a>... but I'm certainly not going to put that much money into the Microsoft ecosystem right now. There is a serious void in the market for a truly <i>great</i>&nbsp;system for this. Something customizable, extensible, ubiquitous, that doesn't have a stupid user interface (LOOKING AT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM).</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">As for <i>my</i>&nbsp;specific case - I'm wanting to taken Computer Science notes. Something you may not know if you've got no experience in programming is that code editors have "syntax highlighting", which basically just changes the color of your text based of what that text <i>means </i>in your code. I'd like to preserve syntax highlighting into my notes. I still haven't really figured out "the" solution for this yet. I'm looking at OneNote again, but may just default back to Google Drive.</span></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /><b>3. How do I manage time &amp; tasks?</b></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br />This question has been the subject of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22time+management%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5">tons of research</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Management-Business-Life-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2569">thousands of books</a>. I'm certainly not an expert, but I did technically succeed in my education and work life thus far, so I guess that gives me some credibility.<br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I've used versions of the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>" method in the past, with varying levels of success... but really I've found that most of the time I can just make lists of tasks and their associated due dates. My life hasn't been so ridiculously helplessly overwhelmed with "to-dos" that a true GTD method was warranted.<br /><br />The best way to do stuff is just to <i>do it</i>. Focus on one task at a time. Take time between tasks to look back at your master task list to ensure you aren't missing focus on something that warrants it. I like to make physical lists for each <i>day</i>, and a master digital list for things in the future. That gives me the satisfaction of physically crossing things off and it pits my tasks against my calendar, which is necessary.<br /><br />Whatever your preferred task &amp; time management solution is - it needs to be paired with structure and discipline to have a chance of success. Right now, I'm breaking my own structure because I'm not disciplined enough to stick to my current 30 Day Challenge's "in bed by 10" rule.<br /><br /><b>In conclusion:</b><br />I really want to go into graduate school with a well-thought out system for doing things. Something built with the experience of high school and my undergrad degree. I don't know what platform I'm going to use for my notes, I don't even know what physical medium I'll be using. I don't want to buy into something and then switch midway through, so I'm suffering from platform anxiety. I should probably be focusing my effort more on <i>which</i>&nbsp;grad program I'll be doing &amp; when, but that's not as fun to think about.<br /><br />This is perhaps the longest Column I've written.&nbsp;I wish it ended with a strong "AND THIS IS HOW I'LL SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS" section, but it didn't end like that. It ended like this.</div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Things I Wish Would Happen</span></div><div><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">5.
