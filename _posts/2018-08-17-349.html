<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Life, One Second a Time</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I had a kid. I'll write about that next time. It's tough to try to get everything I want to say about that together and typed and whatnot - so I'm going to postpone that one and throw out this one. I've got several Columns already in mind right now. Actually that gives me the Top 5 topic.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u60WuXfaNBE" width="800"></iframe><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_AwZQKjplc&amp;list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw" target="_blank">Here's the playlist of all of six videos</a>.</span><br /><br />I'm not writing any more on this topic. That video marked the end of the longest-running creative project I've ever done. This is a cathartic Column.<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Titles of Columns that I've been Trying to Write for the Past Few Days</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. "Sixth Second-A-Day"<br class="kix-line-break" />4. "Feature: Analysis of Human Attractiveness"<br class="kix-line-break" />3. "Make Stuff"<br class="kix-line-break" />2. "Self Help (Yourself)"<br class="kix-line-break" />1. "Griffin"</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"You said you were moving onto something better - and I thought 'I bet I know what that means'."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Ed -</span></span></div>
