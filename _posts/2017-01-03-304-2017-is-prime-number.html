<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: New Year, Same General Idea</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">There's not much time to write this. My laptop is dying. It's already fairly late.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Last year my resolution was to run 12 "challenges" concurrently. Eventually 30 Day Challenges sounded much better than the same 12 things I was trying (and mostly failing) to do. This year I'll be going back to the 30 Day Challenge thing. Otherwise, I don't have any specific resolutions. The ones I've been thinking of generally fall under the following 4 C's:<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Control.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">Comfort.</span><br />Competency.<br />Captain.<br /><br />Control - I want to assert better control over everything in life. Money. Time. Energy.<br />Comfort - I want less of it. Cause that's how you grow.<br />Competency - in everything I want to be good at. Intentionally.<br />Captain - be more like Captain America.<br /><br />That's really the only one that matters.<br /><br />STEVE ROGERS JR, BABY!<br /><br />Have you ever wondered what a connect-the-dots with 1000 dots would look like?<br />This:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dn5szp8dpPk/WGxePvy1KnI/AAAAAAACjgA/ogpO-npTg5cIV89w8Qb6r1FRxpTh-Rv4wCKgB/s1600/IMG_20170103_201953.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dn5szp8dpPk/WGxePvy1KnI/AAAAAAACjgA/ogpO-npTg5cIV89w8Qb6r1FRxpTh-Rv4wCKgB/s640/IMG_20170103_201953.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: My Favorite Movie Scenes (off the top of my head)</span><br /><span style="color: red;">5. Any scene with Tom Cruise in "Tropic Thunder".</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">4. The last fight between Tyler Durden &amp; the narrator.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. The Avengers coming together for the first time to wreck the Chitauri.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. The scene from Rouge One. If you've watched the movie, you know which one. It was phenomenal.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. The airport scene from Civil War.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Hey!
