Something I couldn't quite put my finger on, I couldn't explain. Refresh. Renew. Something should change. I didn't know what. I wasn't "unhappy" by any means, I just felt (careful, here comes a new-agey made up word) under-actualized. I felt like I was growing as a person, and was long overdue for a fresh molt. That's a gross metaphor, but it's appropriate. The shedding an outer layer metaphor works particularly well because my first thought was "I should throw out my wardrobe and buy all new clothes".</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">That's now where I ended up. I <i>am</i>&nbsp;going to do that, to some extent, but it's not where I ended up.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">Before I <i>get</i>&nbsp;to where I ended up, I need to tell a short story.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">Melissa went on a cruise with her sister over New Years. This left me with a solid block of time - time that I spent seeing multiple friends, family, and accomplishing quite a bit. When Melissa got back, she was tired, happy, and crazy tan. She sat down with me to look at the contents of the GoPro she took with her. We plugged it into my Linux laptop and proceeded to watch ~20 minutes of the most frustrating video experience imaginable. My computer couldn't keep up. The 60 frames/second video was running at something closer to 6 frames/second on average. Sometimes it was 60, sometimes it was 0, sometimes it jumped massive sections. There was no audio. There wasn't <i>really</i>&nbsp;video. It was good for what we wanted to do - I got to see images of Honduras and Belize, but I didn't get a <i>video</i>&nbsp;experience.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">So I've decided to refresh my computer.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">That lead to a nearly week-long identity crisis. No joke there was a period of about a day where I thought the most likely of all outcomes was me buying a Mac, and eventually going full-blown Apple when my phone dies (side note - my phone seems like it's on the verge of hardware failure). I considered building a Linux box. Finally, I decided on building a computer and then doing something I promised myself I would never do again...</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">Putting Windows on it.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">It gets worse, I won't just be putting&nbsp;<i>Windows</i>&nbsp;on it - but <b>Windows 8</b>.1.</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">This is happening. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I do somewhat look forward to my transition back to Windows. Linux is awesome, but cumbersome... especially if your Linux machine isn't the computer you spend most of your time on. I'm going back to Windows for the "it just works"-ed-ness, among other reasons (see the Top 5).&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 18.3999996185303px;">I'm excited to build a computer.
