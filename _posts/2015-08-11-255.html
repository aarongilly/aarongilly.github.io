<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Twitter sucks #ProbablyJustJealous</span> <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I don't have a Twitter. I don't like the idea of a stream of small text posts. So here's everything I would have tweeted if I had a Twitter: <br /> <br /><span style="color: #134f5c;"> Any pairing of "good" plus a time of day is either a hello or a goodbye. "Good afternoon" is different than "good night". #RandomObservation <br /> <br /> I'm drinking coffee. I'm in the bathroom. #CircleOfLife <br /> <br /> Roses are grey. Violets are grey. Everything is grey. I am a dog. #HEGOTJOKES <br /> <br /> High Intensity Interval Potty Training #IWasBornFlexing #EnjoyThisBathroomSwellfie <br /> <br /> If an object was perfectly black, it would appear as a shilloute when you looked directly at it. #Interesting <br /> <br /> Just hit a new PR2D2, have fun Chewieing on that C315PO deadlift. #WeightliftingStarWarsJoke #IAmTheForce #Hashtag <br /> <br /> Mission Impossible 1 was good. Mission Impossible 2 was Mission Impossible 1. Mission Impossibles 3 &amp; 4 were Mission Impossible 2. <br /> <br /> I don't understand Twitter. Please everyone disregard the message intended for my wife. I love you all too, but, just... that wasn't for you <br /> <br /> If Google buys Twitter you know he'll be wearing a Twitter T-Shirt on Monday. #Brandist <br /> <br /> Hello Chris Hardwick! I listen to your stuff! Thanks for making my commute less boring. Have on more superheros. I have narrow interests. <br /> <br /> The person behind the checkout counter actually "checked me out". Thanks but no thanks. #Standards #Mirin <br /> <br /> I miss Melissa. <br /> <br /> Ant-Man: What a fun little movie. #DadJokes #DadJokesButReallyThatIsJustMyActualOpinionOfTheMovie <br /> <br /> Revving your engine is for peacocks. Find ways to try to impress people that aren't so loud. I don't like you. <br /> <br />4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 <br /> <br />Peptobismol should run a commercial where it is poured onto the surface of Jupiter, and it ceases being a Gas Giant. #ThatsAStretch  <br /> <br />Abbreva should run a commercial where it is poured onto the surface of Jupiter, and its red spot goes away. #StillStretching <br /> <br />30 Day Challenge: Wake @ 6, Bed @ 10, Eat in, Drink water &amp; coffee, run a mile, 100 pushups, 15 pullups, &amp; 15 minutes stretching. Every day. <br /> <br />Day 2: I'm so tired. I'm so, so very tired. <br /> <br />The word "Alphabet" should really end with a "z". <br /> <br />Day 6: Why am I DOING THIS? #WHYAMIDOINGTHISQUESTIONMARK <br /> <br /> You're fat because you eat too much. The proof is in the pudding. #HESTILLGOTJOKES</span></span> <br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #134f5c;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #134f5c;">I just took this picture: #FoodPic #MyWifeIsAwesome #Deliciousness</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #134f5c;"><br /></span></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PnezZp-nqf0/VcUQzxoXBXI/AAAAAAAB6BU/gcT0HB8qkCQ/s1600/IMG_20150514_191324.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="472" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PnezZp-nqf0/VcUQzxoXBXI/AAAAAAAB6BU/gcT0HB8qkCQ/s640/IMG_20150514_191324.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Advantages with which I was Born</span> <br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. Tall, right-handed, right-eye dominant <br class="kix-line-break" />4. Semi-atheletic build, propensity to lose weight rather than gain it - even into my late twenties <br class="kix-line-break" />3.
