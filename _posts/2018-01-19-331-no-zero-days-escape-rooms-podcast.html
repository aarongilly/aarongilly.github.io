<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Adept at being Inept</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">This isn't going to be fun to read, but It was fun to write.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm not writing about any of the things that have happened lately that would be considered "interesting". You <i>can </i>stop here. No really, it's okay. I'll even do the picture to go out on!</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y9YQh60cs4c/WmKusCU30rI/AAAAAAAC4m8/UjjRuGX6olklRCrbWYWxBg_M4yu_iDQfACKgBGAs/s1600/download_20180115_191759.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1384" data-original-width="1384" height="640" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y9YQh60cs4c/WmKusCU30rI/AAAAAAAC4m8/UjjRuGX6olklRCrbWYWxBg_M4yu_iDQfACKgBGAs/s640/download_20180115_191759.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Not bad Google.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">You should stop.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Alright, your loss.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">2018 has coincided with my best New Year's Resolution yet: </span><b>No Zero Days.</b><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Meaning - I will work, at least a little bit, every single day, toward one of the following:</span><br /><ul><li>Home improvement (not just maintenance)</li><li>Getting a Master's and/or PE and/or PMP certification</li><li>Creating an Android App</li><li>Physical fitness</li><li>The other thing</li><li>+whatever else I deem appropriate for my long-term development</li></ul><span style="font-weight: normal;">Over the holiday, I had a new experience - I failed to escape an escape room. I'm shooting 7 for 8 now. I got to see a new take on the escape room concept. I got to see what a <i>bad</i>&nbsp;room is like. A BAD room...</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">1. Has too many red herrings - especially if the right path forward isn't obvious in hindsight</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">2. Has clues that can be ruined by someone moving them</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">3. Has finicky locks</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">4. Has two or more of the same kind of puzzle, without it being a theme of the room</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">5. Has no <i>real </i>effort put into the decorations</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Now, you could probably argue that I only think the room was bad because I didn't get out. That might be fair BUT IT WAS NOT GOOD!</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">The rest of this Column is me scratching a curiosity itch I have right now relating to podcasts.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I am now going to attempt to count up the total number of Podcast episodes I've listened to/half paid attention to in my life. Rather than fuzzing the numbers by estimating the number of "rebroadcast"-type episodes I've listened to, I'm going to only consider the unique episodes I've listened to since I first found out about podcasts 5 1/2 years ago.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This American Life - 625</span><br />Nerdist Podcast - 500<br /><b>The Weekly Planet</b> - 220<br />All About Android - 200<br />This Week in Google - 200<br /><b>Good Job Brain!</b> - 198<br />This Week in Tech - 150<br />Freakonomics - 150<br /><b>Radiolab</b> - 150<br /><b>Do Go On</b> - 117<br />Stuff You Should Know - 100<br />Filthy Casuals - 50<br />Movie Fights - 40<br /><b>Serial</b>&nbsp;- 23<br />Planet Money - 20<br />Hardcore History - 12<br />Pod Save America - 10<br /><b>S-Town</b> - 7<br />+ 50 random episodes of other stuff over the ages<br /><br /><b>Bold</b> indicates I've heard every available episode.<br /><br />That's 2822 episodes. I first learned about podcasts during a trip I took in August, 2012. That's slightly under 2000 days ago. In other words, I've averaged somewhere close to 1.5 podcast episodes a day. Factor in episodes I've heard more than once and you'd definitely hit 1.5 episodes a day.<br /><br />How about that.<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Catchphrases I'm Workshopping</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
