<div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Round and Round We Go</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Routine.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Imagine life without it. It would be chaos. Everyone has routines they go through every day. You do the same things in the same ways. Try putting your pants on starting with your off-leg and you'll see what I mean. It feels weird.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We have little routines. We have big ones. Our big routines are made up of little ones.&nbsp;</span>Butting routines together forms a loop. These loops exist at different levels, too. You loop your mornings, your afternoons, your evenings. You loop your days. You loop your weeks. On a long enough timeline, your months and years take on similar characteristics.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">You wake up. You prep for work. You commute. You manage tasks and email until lunch. You eat. You manage tasks and email until it's time to leave. You commute. You do a hobby. You cook food. You eat. You entertain yourself. You sleep. Loop.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">You work. You work. You work. You work. You work. You engage in social activities. You gather and organize and prepare for the week. Loop.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is all necessary to be successful. If you didn't have established routines, you'd spend a lot of your day bumbling around trying to figure out why nothing is working. You know how to get things done because you know what works. You know what makes you happy. You do what breeds success and it makes you successful. You do what breeds happiness and it makes you happy. But as you do your successful, happy little loops <i><span style="color: #999999; font-size: x-small;">(as Bob Ross would call them)</span></i>, the flaws in them become more obvious. The gaps in what they accomplish grow as your body and brain adapt to better accomplish what's in the loops you run.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Let me wrap it into an example:</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Mondays are leg days.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Tuesdays are chest and tris.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Wednesdays are break.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Thursdays are back and bis.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Fridays are burnout leg days.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Saturdays are burnout all upper body.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Sundays are break.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Loop.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Now you're strong. Now you're cut.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">But you can't run. You can't touch your toes or scratch your own back.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Now let me rap it into an example:</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Yo.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">You write down tasks.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Do what your boss asks.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Communicate effectively.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Collaborate selectively.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Master spreadsheets and lists.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Faster than life cheats, it's this</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">that will make you good employee.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">That will take you, wait and see.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">If you fail to consider bigger notions,</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">don't set sail to some broader oceans,</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">you will trail when it's time for promotions.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Dawg.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">That whole thing was me talking about focusing on getting things done to further a project, in lieu of focusing on getting things done to further a career. Hopefully those two things overlap.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Anyway.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">The challenge I'm facing now is addressing these shortcomings. Covering the gaps. Can you construct a loop that covers all the bases? I think that's what I have been trying with some of the projects I've been running for the past 4 or 5 years... but the longer a project goes, the more you revert back to base behavior. I set goals, do a great job with them at first, but after a bit I'm back to baseline Aaron. The goal is present, but the change in behavior is not.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I set up my Life Tracker with 25 daily goals so that I'd try to accomplish them.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I started filming a second a day so that I'd make sure each day had an interesting second.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I started 30 Day Challenges to try out intentionally and selectively break routines.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I've learned a lot from all of those things over the years. But what I've learned from them lately is that they aren't as motivating as they once were. The law of diminishing returns is in full effect. Just like how constantly doing the same happy loops will cause them to bring less and less joy.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I don't fault myself for doing any of those things I do. I've been intentionally trying to better myself. I won't rest on my laurels. Even if the things I try are 90% ineffective, I'll be 10% better off for it. At least that's the theory.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I'm going to sunset the Life Tracker in 6 months. I've been at it for 4.5 years. It's done what I wanted it to do. I've learned a lot from it... and I'm not sure I'll ever <i>really</i>&nbsp;fully stop tracking things. But it's time for something new. I want to implement what I've learned to build something better of myself and for myself. I want my loops to contain more intentionally unintentional sections. Variety is the spice of life.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br />Let the chips fall where they may.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Say Yes more.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Live more.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I'm ready for what's next.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uKFFwAoA-FI/Wc_SCP2dKOI/AAAAAAACxYQ/GceOkRV9CmUGP1SybO5qdveLsYDQ342-ACLcBGAs/s1600/ink%2B%25282%2529.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="831" data-original-width="1600" height="332" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uKFFwAoA-FI/Wc_SCP2dKOI/AAAAAAACxYQ/GceOkRV9CmUGP1SybO5qdveLsYDQ342-ACLcBGAs/s640/ink%2B%25282%2529.png" width="640" /></a></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br />With all that said, if your black X is co-located with your blue circle, by all means, take the red path.<br /><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Other Things I've Thought About Lately</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. This one is stupid and obvious, but:&nbsp;</span></div><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace; font-weight: normal;">Efficiency = (Effective Actions)/(Total Actions)</span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">If you're doing something that's not wholly effective, then your efficiency sucks.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Similarly, the effective thing to do is not always the easy thing to do. But the thing that's most effective winds up being easiest in the end. Through the Transitive Property of Equality, the easiest thing to do isn't the easy thing to do.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. The great smartphone plateau started somewhere around 2015. Once the iPhone got bigger, it stopped really getting better. My Nexus 6P is two years old, and it's still a phenomenal device. I don't think we'll see another "must-have" upgrade until our phones stop being little slates we carry around.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. Rick and Morty is a great show... but it's the kind of great show that I wouldn't really recommend to most people. It's a great show to those who think it's a great show.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Allergies suck.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"I'M PICKLE RICK!"</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Me, after hitting a relatively good golf shot the other day... also several others over the past few weeks -</span></div></div>
