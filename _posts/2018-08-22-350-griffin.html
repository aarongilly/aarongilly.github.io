<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">As a Father: THE THERMOSTAT IS NOT TO BE TOUCHED&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">On 8/8/18, Griffin was born.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I was born on 8/1/88, which is his birthday backwards. I think that's pretty neat.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">It feels weird to say "I became a dad", because it feels weird to <i>be</i>&nbsp;a dad. The whole thing feels weird. Weird and good.&nbsp;</span>Griffin is the first baby I've spent more than 5 minutes around. The first baby that I've held while he cried. The first baby I've soothed. The first baby whose diaper I've changed. The only baby I've ever <i>wanted</i> to hold.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">I always wanted a kid because I have some romantic feelings about life and love and purpose and our biological imperatives and existence and stuff... but it turns out that having a kid also comes with some other neat things. The prospect of getting to shape an entire person as he grows up is really exciting. I really look forward to each of his individual stages of development. I can't wait for it to have "all gone too fast", as they say. I want to see this little dude thru it all, teach him about what's right and wrong, tell him all the best jokes, and ways to do stuff. I want to see him learn math, and have to tell him "I don't know, just because that's the way it is" during his "why" phase. I look forward to the "pick up your toys" phase. I can't wait to stomp him in videogames, then slowly start to lose to him.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We named Griffin "Griffin" because we liked the name, because we wanted to have a name with double letters, because we liked the alliteration, because we liked that it wasn't a common first name and also not completely unheard of, because we liked that its easy to pronounce, and we liked the lose connection to Harry Potter. We did <i>not</i>&nbsp;name him Griffin in honor of the Griffin family from Family Guy (although I do enjoy that show). Griffin has already grown into his name and I couldn't possibly imagine him being named anything else.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Life is a matter of balance. Balance, addition, and subtraction. I added a LOT to life in the past 2 weeks, and naturally that means I'll have to subtract some other things. Hopefully I can have some hand in the picking and choosing about what parts of my old life I jettison to make room for the new. I'm sure it won't be exactly what I would have picked, but I'm also sure it won't be exactly what I wouldn't have. And I'm sure it will all have been worth it.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: PICTURES OF MY KID</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
