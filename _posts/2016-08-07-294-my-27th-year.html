<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Jason Unbourne</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I haven't written in a while because I haven't had internet in a while. Melissa and I are moving to a full-blown house in less than a week*. Rather than pay for a half-month of internet, I elected to go ahead and cancel our home service. MELISSA and (sorta) I have been packing up our entire place, so the free time has been reduced somewhat. Packing and consolidating and repacking and reconsolidating. Plus working, maintaining a decent-ish workout routine, a social life, and a happy/healthy relationship... the Column has taken a backseat.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">*assuming all goes as planned.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Pokemon Go exploded. It's huge in a way I would not have believed one month ago. I've got mixed feeling about it and its popularity - but that hasn't stopped us from "Pokemoning" for hours on end many times over the past two weeks. I'm level 18 as of this writing. I hope to be level 19 by the time I finish this post (assuming any pokemon show up at all at Whole Foods). Thanks to this game, I've visited Loose Park, gone to the Plaza twice, been to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art... but I've been mostly staring at my phone during that time. Right now I'm mostly for it. Melissa and I are having fun together, and that's what matters to me most. I'll have more fun when I find a Charizard.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Jason Bourne" came out. Spoilers: it was hugely disappointing. I revere the first 3 movies as my top 3 favorite movies in the action genre. This one was devastatingly disappointing. I'm more hard on it than most of the critics I've read. I thought it was mostly a pile of garbage. I rewatched the original trilogy in anticipation of the new one. They hold up - so I know it's not just "my tastes have changed"... it's that "Jason Bourne" didn't have NEARLY enough actual <i>Jason Bourne</i>. There was too much bullcrap "tech" stuff jammed in. Too much side character focus. Too much side plot. WAY TOO MUCH shakeycam. Overall I give the film a "WHY" out of ten.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Thursday Melissa and I will become homeowners. That puts us one dog and 2.4 children away from "The American Dream". I'm all for it. I can't wait to have a place to settle down, build up some equity, and begin the next phase of my life with my wife whose the love of my life. We've been doing a pretty good for the past four years (which you'll have the chance to glimpse into soon), but I get a feeling that by staying put we're about to start&nbsp;</span>really going places. We love the place, and have some ideas that hopefully will make us love it even more. I'm sure I'll have pictures on here soon.<br /><br />Jason Bourne, Pokemon Go, I've got one other piece of trending thing Aaron opinions to share - it's about the Prisma app. I'd heard about it in weeks past in many of the various tech-related podcasts I listen to on my commute, but I hadn't bothered getting around to try it until earlier today.<br /><br />Holy crap.<br /><br />It's cool, dude. I don't need to tell you, though, I can just show you:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JulGRfDf23Q/V6feOPG3u_I/AAAAAAACZNY/RXzJNgE2JHEP4ACD9bfkQfTQybAgPuepwCKgB/s1600/b25191e8983601de44f03d7bbd2e5eb4resNetFinal_8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

Come that day I bet I'll probably use that as my Top 5.<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Pros of Owning a House (I assume)</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. SO MUCH MORE ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES!<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Seriously, so much more room. Room for a kid. Room for guests. Room for a gym. Room for an office. Room for a second bathroom. Room for a 3rd. Room to park your cars.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. Freedom to do what you want.&nbsp;"I think I'd like to draw a big smiley face on this wall." "I think I'd like to play the djembe even though it's 2am." "I think I'd like to change how this looks."<br class="kix-line-break" />2. Not throwing money away on a monthly basis. Plus, the amount you get in return for the increased cost is really pretty amazing. I can't believe how little our monthly payments are going up compared to the amount we get back from it.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Having a place that is really and truly <i>yours</i>.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Cons of Owning a House (I assume)</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.&nbsp;"Well it turns out I need to move to Cleveland... should I go through the hassle of selling my house or just slam every finger I own in every door I own instead?"</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">4.&nbsp;Big ticket expenses that could hit at any time.<br class="kix-line-break" />3.&nbsp;No more "maintenance guys" to call when something breaks.<br class="kix-line-break" />2.&nbsp;There's only TWO Pokestops within walking distance. What is this, the Dark Ages?<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Mowing the lawn. I don't care if it's not a "manly" thing to say, mowing the lawn sucks.</span><br /><div><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span> <br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"I was just hearing a fair amount of mouth and nose sounds."</span> <br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Danielle -</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"><br /></span> <span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"You should be smug at a minimum."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Chuck -</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"><br /></span> <span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Also I dare anyone to listen to 'X Gon Give It to Ya' and not get jacked."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Joe -</span></div>
