<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: WELCOME TO MY NATION OF ARTICULATION</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm an adult, dude.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm sitting at the table in my kitchen, the one that used to be my only table. I own a table. I own a <i>kitchen</i>. My number of refrigerators went from zero to two in a single day. I own a lawn mower. I paid money to buy a thing whose soul purpose is to perform a task I used to despise doing (and, in all likelihood, will continue to despise). I have a second table right over there. There's four chairs at it, that I also own. I bought all these things because I need to use them from time to time.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">More than just possessions, though - I'm an adult because I have opinions about insurance companies &amp; taxes. I have a wife an a retirement account. I'm closer to 30 than 20, closer to 50 than 5. I'm an adult because "he's too young to have known any better" is not a viable excuse for anything anymore. "I value my time" has replaced "I don't wanna" as an excuse for not doing boring things. I worry about people and things that aren't myself and my things. I'm an adult because I the prospect of having a kid no longer sounds like "the worst thing that could happen".&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm an adult because I know how to solve problems &amp; I'm confident in my ability to do so. I recognize limitations and don't think I shouldn't need help. I'm an adult because I can use double-negatives without fear of losing points on the assignment. I care more about what I think of me than what random people on the street think of me. I listen to talk radio more than the Top 40. Young people reference things I don't know about. I'm an adult because I have legitimate right to complain about "well we didn't have </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><b>laptops</b>&nbsp;in school back when I was your age!". I have a 40 hour/week job that I don't mind working at for 55 if it gets the job done. I like HGTV. Going to Home Depot and Lowes doesn't bore me out of my mind anymore. I think about school districts. I feel feelings that other people are feeling, even though the thing that happened to them didn't happen to me - so why should I feel anything at all? That never used to happen.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm an adult because I can disagree with someone wholeheartedly, but still respect their opinions and choices. I love spreadsheets. I made a modification to the desk that I own using tools I bought and it all went pretty well. I don't have a bedtime, but I give myself one anyways... which is why I've got to wrap this up.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>This is me:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IKrLgIrDDVQ/V8T52xIaiZI/AAAAAAACawA/eKG2aqil9CYmJrSOHXFUyE8hUCJ131AeACLcB/s1600/%2523295%2B-%2BI%2527m%2Ban%2BAdult.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IKrLgIrDDVQ/V8T52xIaiZI/AAAAAAACawA/eKG2aqil9CYmJrSOHXFUyE8hUCJ131AeACLcB/s400/%2523295%2B-%2BI%2527m%2Ban%2BAdult.png" width="306" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Counter Arguments to this Whole Post</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. I just made a reference to The Lonely Island.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. I really want the next Nintendo when it comes out.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. I just wrote probably near 100 sentences that all start with "I", or have an "I" implied at their beginnings.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. I squeal like a toddler when the Marvel logo shows up at the beginning of a movie. Well, a movie of a certain canon.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. I ate this post while wearing jammies &amp; eating Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese for dinner. Not as a side, Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese was the entire dinner.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"They taste better because they're shaped like dinosaurs."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Nick -</span></div>
