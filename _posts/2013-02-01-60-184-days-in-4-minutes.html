I just started the render for the updated version of my second-a-day video. This post is being created specifically to showcase the video because, as of this writing, I am exactly 24 1/2 years old... which means my video is exactly half finished. In an hour and twenty minutes, I'll upload it to YouTube. When that upload gets done (probably another hour, at least) I will put the video right below this line. For you, it's been there this whole time.</span></b><br /><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LwKz4VpiTrM/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LwKz4VpiTrM?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LwKz4VpiTrM?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br /><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></b><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">This has truly been the longest I've ever worked on some project that was "just for fun". Unless you count skateboarding. I did that for 7 years. Some people are professional skateboarders after 2 years. Took me 7 to get somewhat competent. Skateboarding, though, is what introduced me to making videos. As you may know, all real skateboarders have to be on camera so they can be <i>seen</i> skateboarding; otherwise, what's the point, right? Putting together my first skateboard video started a chain of events that eventually led me to filming something every day for a year. This project was a relatively large undertaking when I started it. I didn't honestly think I'd be able to keep it up. But I have, and I'm glad. It's one of my favorite things I've ever made.</span></span></b><br /><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span></b>I think that video works best for <i>me</i>. Other people might like it... but <i>I'm</i>&nbsp;the only person who knows the other people in it, who went through the events documented, who has the memories. Everyone should do something like this. It's fantastic what you do in half a year.<br /><br />I will now provide an very incomplete list of some comments for&nbsp;some of these seconds:<br /><br /><ul><li>August 1st - My birthday.

Most of this blog is done for my own amusement, anyway.<br /><br />In other news, I had a highly productive day and I celebrated by eating a whole Digiorno pizza.<br /><br /><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Droid Sans;"><span style="font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Did you catch my movie/tv show/song/book reference?
