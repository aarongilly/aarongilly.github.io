<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: THIS IS SPARTA</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I've written 300 of these. That's a round number which seems significant. It's not, though. If humans had 12 fingers instead of 10, I'd likely be telling you this is post number "12C".</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">That's a hexidecimal joke. Base 16, y'all.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">It's glorious outside right now. I'm probably going to go on a bike ride soon to take advantage of this wonderful fall weather.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Pokemon Go is dying. I feel like conscious choices made by the developers of the application are to blame for their drop in player numbers. I still play, but likely will quit once show starts falling unless Niantic changes their minds about things.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Today it occurred to me that, while I've taken a TON of data on myself by way of the Life Tracker, I had never really done any correlations between anything other than day of week, month of year, and against a simple list of day tags. Never before had I stopped to think "how does my sleep correlate to my eating?" See the Top 5(s) for some results.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Having a home gym is awesome. I set a squat PR earlier today... in my underwear. It was great.<br /><br />October marks the start of my annual quest to "eat as much as possible and gain more weight". So far, I've done terribly. Food is not something I resort to out of boredom. Even if it were, I haven't been bored much in October. I haven't been bored much in the past year or two, really. Being married, owning a house, being employed, and having friends all come together to make life pretty darn good.<br /><br />No complaints.<br /><br />I'm going to end this Column now. I am deleting a large rant about Pokemon Go and replacing it with a much shorter paragraph (which you've already read - I write these posts in a non-linear fashion) about general disappointment with the game.<br /><br />Picture to go out on - we like each other.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PlG0cm-q4ug/WAKiRHsDoaI/AAAAAAACdxk/Pai3N888vMUzLaLXkvJPsWFlOVrLJqTQwCLcB/s1600/IMG_0019.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PlG0cm-q4ug/WAKiRHsDoaI/AAAAAAACdxk/Pai3N888vMUzLaLXkvJPsWFlOVrLJqTQwCLcB/s640/IMG_0019.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Correlated Data Points in the Life Tracker that Make Sense</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. My data is less complete the longer I wait to enter it (entry delay vs completeness: CC = -0.576)<br class="kix-line-break" />4. I spend more money when I eat more overall (expense vs total caloric intake: CC = 0.118)<br class="kix-line-break" />3. I feel better physically when I workout more (exercise frequency vs how I feel physically: CC = 0.298)<br class="kix-line-break" />2. I eat less overall if I eat a higher amount of protein (total caloric intake vs percent protein: CC = -0.206)<br class="kix-line-break" />1. I feel better mentally when I feel better physically (how I feel mentally vs how I feel physically: CC = 0.330)</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Correlated Data Points in the Life Tracker that make No Sense</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"></span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. I sleep less when I eat more (sleep duration vs total caloric intake: CC = -0.208<br class="kix-line-break" />4. The more I workout the more money I spend (exercise frequency vs expense: CC = 0.196)<br class="kix-line-break" />3.&nbsp;I feel worse mentally when I workout more (exercise frequency vs how I feel mentally: CC = -0.150)<br class="kix-line-break" />2. I feel worse mentally when I eat more fats (how I feel mentally vs percent fat: CC = -0.136<br class="kix-line-break" />1. In general - the almost complete lack of correlation between sleep duration and anything else (other than food).</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"You play Pokemon?
