<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: The words need to fit together. The paragraphs do not.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Writing.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Every time I start a Column it starts with the single word "Writing". I go in and change it to say other stuff usually, but today I felt like leaving it. No further words need to be said about that.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">If I stuck were in a room with nothing but a window. I wonder how much time would have to pass before I noticed time wasn't passing.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Whoever said variety is the spice of life was a smart dude. He probably also just got out of a rut of some sort.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">My Roomba plays a little fanfare when it's done cleaning and successfully returns back to its base station to rejuice. You can hear it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkTVAd_YYc4">the first 8 seconds of this YouTube video</a>. I haven't thought much about tune before - but today when it was finished I instinctively said "chaaarge!". Only after I said that out loud, did I realize some product designer has a sense of humor.&nbsp;</span>iRobot must hire dads. Pretty good.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Spiderman: Homecoming was great. I don't want to leave a review yet, cause I've only seen it once. It's worth the rewatch. A review may or may not come later. On a tangential note: THAT is how you make a movie that's part of a greater universe. You don't show a guy opening some emails, or a bunch of costumes in a basement. This is a perfect franchise movie.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The past 6 weeks my sleep has been nosediving.</span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace; font-weight: normal;">8:28</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace; font-weight: normal;">7:37</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace; font-weight: normal;">7:25</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace; font-weight: normal;">6:54</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">6:23</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">5:39</span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Those are the actual measurements, in order, of the average duration of my past 6 weeks. I have no idea what's going on. I've slept almost 3 hours PER NIGHT less this week than I did a month and a half ago.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">This weekend was great.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Golf is a fun, if frustrating game.</span><br /><br /><b>Reasons I like bars:</b><br />- ostensibly, they facilitate meeting new people<br />- their lighting is usually a bit dim, which is how I like rooms to be<br /><b><br /></b><b>Reasons I dislike bars:</b><br />- the people I meet at bars are not generally people I want to meet<br />- the types of conversations I like having are not possible in that environment<br />- the types of conversations I hate having happen way too often<br />- the conversations that are held, are usually held at a volume I cannot discern from the crazy loud ambient noise<br />- the expected behavior of people at bars is not in any way in line with how I like behaving<br />- the atmosphere usually ranges from mildly aggressive to outright threatening<br />- the concept of personal space is foreign<br />- desperate people scream for attention<br />- the food is some combination of bad, bad for you, and expensive<br />- the drinks are more expensive than the kind you'd bring to a friend's house<br />- the sanitation is usually minimal at best, if the place isn't outright gross<br />- there's always some guy who will come try to join my group to hit on all the girls in it, even the one I'm married to<br /><br />Given the choice between going to a friend's house or going to a bar, I'll chose the friend's house 100 times out of 100.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Next up: The Defenders.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Humidity and wind chill are a thing because we are a warm-blooded animal. There is a constant thermodynamic back-and-forth between us and the pocket of air around us. If that pocket of air has a ton of water in it, it becomes harder to cool off, thus it feels hotter. If that pocket if air is replaced with <i>new</i>&nbsp;air, it feels cooler. That's kind of neat to think about.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's a picture of me from today:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X115le6EAR8/WWWTCqjoCoI/AAAAAAACtCA/ZU6oh-aCD04MJPhxAy2pFLnfCeUZH97fQCLcBGAs/s1600/Thoracic%2B1%2B%25282%2529.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1240" data-original-width="983" height="640" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X115le6EAR8/WWWTCqjoCoI/AAAAAAACtCA/ZU6oh-aCD04MJPhxAy2pFLnfCeUZH97fQCLcBGAs/s640/Thoracic%2B1%2B%25282%2529.PNG" width="506" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>I'm 50% sure that dark part is my heart.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Life Tips from Aaron Gillespie</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
