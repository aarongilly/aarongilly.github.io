<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: :-(</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">21 hours ago I walked into a theater to watch one of the most anticipated movies... ever. The levels of hype varied from source to source - but all were looking forward to seeing it.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I was going to write a big long review of Batman V Superman, but honestly, there are so many reviews all over the internet that I couldn't possibly contribute anything&nbsp;<i>new</i>&nbsp;to the conversation. Instead, I'm mostly going to focus on the trailers, then have a Top 5 disappointing things &amp; Top 5 not disappointing things.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">The following video will contain all the spoilers for Batman vs. Superman:</span><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fis-9Zqu2Ro" width="800"></iframe><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">That's the 2nd trailer Warner Bros released for Batman V Supes. It's essentially a 3 minute version of the entire movie, presented basically in the order in which it happened, missing only small amounts of action one, arguably two plot points.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">While we are talking about trailers getting people excited at the expense of them enjoying the movie later on...</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's the 3rd trailer they released:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gO8g90z3VU" width="800"></iframe><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />This trailer is slightly less spoiler-ey, but commits the second-worst cardinal sin a trailer can commit: it shows the climax of the movie. In this case, it shows Batman's awesome fight sequence. When I saw this trailer I thought "oh sweet! Batman is going to kick butt the whole movie!" Little did I know that the first 20 seconds of this trailer are basically just <i>all of the cool parts</i>&nbsp;of the only sequence Batman has like this... and it's at the very end of the movie.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Trailers should give you a feel for the tone of the movie, and optionally tease the plot. They should leave you wondering "gee, what happens in the rest of this movie!" Basically, they serve the same purpose as the first act of a story... so they should be composed primarily of the first act of a movie. What they should absolutely <i>not</i>&nbsp;do is show you not only the climax, but ALL of the COOLEST parts of the climax. They shouldn't say "okay, so this happens, then this happens, then this happens, then this happens, then the movie is over. If you enjoyed this trailer, there's a longer version at your local cinema!"</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The trailers for Batman V Superman&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;did the movie a disservice. I don't think it would be a "good" movie for anyone who hadn't seen the trailers, but not seeing them certainly would have helped.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">That's just my opinion.</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Regarding the #3 disappointing thing in the upcoming Top 5 - here's the picture to go out on:</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MYADYyYy05c/VwFiHXOBkcI/AAAAAAACJkk/8Y-Wjhe4GdY5q-S4AJhBYNyz5zh8uxvTA/s1600/%2523285%2B-%2BBatman%2Bv%2BSupes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MYADYyYy05c/VwFiHXOBkcI/AAAAAAACJkk/8Y-Wjhe4GdY5q-S4AJhBYNyz5zh8uxvTA/s640/%2523285%2B-%2BBatman%2Bv%2BSupes.jpg" width="324" /></a></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Side note - you may notice the quotes in my posts are higher in quality now. That's side benefit #73 of my new job. Funny people saying funny things.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Not Disappointing Things about Batman V Superman</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. This movie addressed the chief complaints of Man of Steel head on<br class="kix-line-break" />4.&nbsp;The fight sequences were pretty cool, on the whole<br class="kix-line-break" />3. There were some very great visuals<br class="kix-line-break" />2. The opening scene, following Bruce Wayne during the events at the climax of Man of Steel, was fantastic<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Like everyone else, I think that Ben Affleck was a great Bruce Wayne &amp; Batman... and Henry Cavill could be a great Superman, given some better writing</span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Disappointing Things about Batman V Superman (ACTUAL SPOILERS AHEAD)</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.&nbsp;Batman V Superman was 2 1/2 hours long, the Batman versus Superman fight scene was 2 1/2 minutes long. Batman's fight scene was great, but I'd already seen it.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />4.&nbsp;Lex Luthor was interesting, but not really <i>Lex Luther</i>. No other characterization of Lex Luthor I've ever seen has he acted so... crazy. He was a very Joker-y Lex Luthor. That's not his character.<br class="kix-line-break" />3.&nbsp;The movie feels like a setup for the Justice League moreso than a movie. The introduction of the other Justice League superheroes was awkwardly presented, and really <i>really</i>&nbsp;weirdly placed in the movie. Marvel's "after the credits teaser" is great, DC should have done that.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />2.&nbsp;Batman and Superman both kill people. That's a huge deal to some people.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. They crammed a TON of otherwise great storylines together, presenting terrible, half-baked versions of each. Given that this movie is supposed to be setup for a long-running DC canon, they have to play in the world that this movie lives in. They can no longer use Doomsday. They can't do a proper "death of Superman" storyline. They can't give us a Batman V Superman fight with more meaning &amp; substance. They have to deal with a crazy Lex Luthor. They killed off Superman's best friend without even mentioning his name. This one movie kinda sucking has implications that will last for years (or until they reboot the franchise again).</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span> <br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Did you notice the pronounced sternum on that horse?
