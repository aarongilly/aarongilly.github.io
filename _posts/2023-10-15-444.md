This is the follow-up to [#435](https://aarongilly.com/435/). I have officially, **finally**, wrapped up active development on my most recent *(and hopefully last)* complete, bottom-up re-write of my Life Tracker/Personal Data Warehouse. This post is about that Project and what it’s been like to keep pretty good tabs on the last 10+ years of my life.

So strap in or bail out now.

# 10 Years Tracked

I’ve already written several[^1] times describing “The Life Tracker” before, so I’ll skip some of the pleasantries. Here’s it in a 🥜:

I have developed & iterated on a quantified self, life-tracking project for more than 10 years now. It includes data about my life, health, and other things I find interesting.

This post is a brief celebration and retrospective on having hit the 10 year mark. 

## Growing Pains

I developed an increasingly well-honed system up until the 5-year anniversary. I then spent 5 years in tinker town trying to make something that seems *incredibly simple* on the surface work out.

It turns out cardinality is one of the single hardest concepts to engineer a system around.

5 years ago I decided to grow beyond my “everything in one big spreadsheet” system. I’ll be honest, I’m pretty sure it was better before it got so complicated. The thing that used to bother me about it could have been solved with orders of magnitude less effort & fewer lines of code.

# The Largest Coding Project Ever

Man. This took a **while**. Frankly, way longer than I expect, way longer than I was afraid of. Longer than I would have ever even ********imagined********.

It didn’t need to.

I’m not planning on writing about “how it all works” here. That will be the subject for another day, another page on this website. Not a regular blog, but some sort of “for purpose” page, for anyone who wants to emulate what I’ve done. I’ll save you some very painful lessons learned.

But.

## Desired Difficulty

There’s such a thing as “desired difficulty”. As anyone who’s ever used an invincibility cheat code in a video game will tell you, if things are too easy they lose their fun. If you aren’t struggling some, then there’s no meaning behind it all.  

If this had all been an app I downloaded then blindly followed, I don’t think I’d have followed it for very long before losing interest and finding something else to do.

## 6. Media

Tracking media is a large part of the reason I wanted to start tracking things that happen might happen multiple times per day. These I don’t have a decade of data for, but do have 5 years which is still a ton.

### Movies

![](/assets/images/444-movies.png)

My movie watching has died off since I started tracking. I used to watch a movie every 5 days or so, now I’m down to a couple times a month. This includes Netflix and Video-on-Demand type movies, but does not include movies I put on for my kids to watch that I’m not really watching. My re-watching of movies I’ve already seen before has gone waaay down.

### Television

Television I never really figured out “how” I wanted to track. If I binged something like “Squid Game” in one night, do I want to track that I had one session of watching Squid Game, or do I want to track the number of episodes of Squid Game? Or the *time spent* watching Squid Game? I wound up doing what was easiest, and just tracking sessions. Some of these were multiple episodes, some were not. But the gross trend is about right, less television overall:

I couldn’t find a more elegant way to present those data. That’s a screen grab from [pdw.one](http://pdw.one).

Hey every year I’ve watched a least one sports game. Sports!

### Videogames

I’m not a big video gamer, it turns out.

![](/assets/images/)

The only real takeaway here is that I play video games about 50 times a year, except when I started playing Super Smash Brothers online in 2020. 

I wish I found an easy method to track the amount of time played in each game. The Switch has *some* functionality for that, but nothing I can easily tap into.

## 5. Weight

Honestly there’s not a ton to see here. My weight’s never been too dramatic. I included my min & max measures from each year to give a sense of range, but mostly cause otherwise this is a boring chart.

## 4. Travel

![](/assets/images/)

I track where I sleep each night as a proxy for travel. My phone wakes up at 3:30AM, pings my location & sends it to the cloud. For some reason, in 2022, I *really* stayed at home. That’s >20 days at home for every 1 day out. Crazy.

{:style="color:red"}

## 3. Sleep

![](/assets/images/)

Aside from sleep *location*, I’ve tracked several other aspects of my sleep throughout the years. Before I bought an Oura ring in August 2019 my dataset was limited to when I went to bed, when I woke up, and the number of minutes that elapsed in between. Looking at “time in bed”, things look pretty consistent. 

![](/assets/images/)

Since buying the Oura ring I’ve had access to time actually spent *sleeping*. This shows that, pretty consistently, don’t actually *sleep* for 45 minutes to 1 hour of the time I’m in bed. Interestingly, the birth of my first child corresponded with much less time in bed, but the birth of the second child corresponded with a permanent *increase* in my time spent in bed. Probably because two kids makes you tired.

![](/assets/images/)

Mostly for pseudo-completeness, that’s the standard deviation of the time I spent in bed. For those of you who didn’t pay attention in stats class, standard deviation is a measure of how “spread out” the data are. The smaller the standard deviation, the closer we’d expect a typical data point to be to the mean. **TL;DR** - I’m getting more consistent with my bedtime since the birth of my boys.

## 2. Workouts by Type

![](/assets/images/)

My interest in exercise jumped hard from 2015 to 2016, but aside from that has more or less stayed pretty consistent. I took up more yoga in 2020 and 2021 to make up for the lack of *sports* during the pandemic. I’m happy to say that the 2023 line is on pace to rival 2016 for my most active year.

## 1. Summary

The most valuable thing I do is just write about my day each night. I can see “on this day” for the past 10 years of my life. There's no way to summarize these data in a way that's interesting or appropriate for public release. It's there, and it's the most valuable thing in all of this.

You could say this is the word of the Hedonic Treadmill?
