# The Notes are Back

~6 months ago I switched by body of evergreen notes from [Notion](http://notion.so) to [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) as part of an effort to give these notes the best chance of still being around in 30 years. With that came the loss of the free notes publishing service. While Obsidian is stellar, their subscription for their publishing service is slightly too pricey for my taste at this point in time[^1]. So, I was unable to publish the 256 notes I’ve created since July, 2023.

That’s changed now: 

{: .notice--primary}
👉 [My notes](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app).

That’s the master index. The notes aren’t laid out so that they can be read end-to-end[^2]. Instead, they’re this densely interlinked web:

So, as an alternative to the link above, see the Top 5 for five somewhat randomly-chosen starting off points.

## The [Standard Process](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/Standard-Processes)

Despite how *involved* this whole thing looks, it's really not all that crazy or difficult.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Read something]
    B[Think of something]
    C[Hear something]
    D(Write it down)
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    E[Add to Obsidian & link to other notes]
    D --periodically--> E
```

It just involves using an [inbox](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/Inbox) to perform [ongoing capture](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/Ongoing-Capture), and periodically cleaning it out. It's [nibbling at the elephant](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/Minimum-Viable-Progress), a [little bit, consistently](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/Small-but-Consistent-beats-Big-but-Sporadic), [over time](https://notes-aarongilly.vercel.app/Prefer-a-Long-Term-Philosophy).

**Note:** I don't plan to do this "linking to my notes everywhere" thing in most Columns. Doing it here because it's the point of this post.

# Other Local-First Changes

5 months ago I wrote about “[local vs the cloud](https://aarongilly.com/439/#notion--obsidian)” and my intention to become (slightly) less dependent on hardware & services that might [pull a Google](https://killedbygoogle.com). I presented my “[so what](https://aarongilly.com/439/#so-what)” to illustrate what I was going to do about it. Since that time I *also* successfully moved my quantified-self system to something that’s modularized and portable. I can run it locally, too.

Yay me.
