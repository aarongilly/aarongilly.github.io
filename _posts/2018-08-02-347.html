<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Optimism Meets Realism Meets Writing</span><br /><br /><div style="font-family: Tinos;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Fifteen million seven hundred sixty-eight thousand minutes!</span></div><div style="font-family: Tinos;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Fifteen million seven hundred sixty-eight thousand&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">moments so dear!</span></div><div style="font-family: Tinos;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Fifteen million seven hundred sixty-eight thousand&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">minutes!</span></div><div style="font-family: Tinos;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">How do you measure, measure 30 years?</span></div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I measured 5 years using the Life Tracker. I know that doesn't account for the other 5/6ths of the data you asked about. Sorry I don't know what to tell you.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">That's right. I started a retrospective of the past 30 years of my life with a R.E.N.T. joke. Clearly I'm going&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><b>deep</b></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;with this Column.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://www.aarongilly.com/2013/08/103-25-years-of-awesome.html" target="_blank">Five Years ago I wrote a Column</a>&nbsp;talking about how awesome turning 25 is and how awesome the next 25 years were going to be. I wrote how I was excited to relive every day I had already been alive, but with "<i>at least my current level of understanding and faculty, my current level of independence and capability</i>". Looking back I see what I was getting at... but I might take a slightly less "everything is great" approach. In the last five years I've struggled with things I never had before. I'm forgetting things I learned in college. I'm hurt myself while exercising. I've hurt myself while&nbsp;<i>warming up</i>&nbsp;to exercise.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">BUT!</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I've gotten married. I've also switched jobs to one I enjoy. I've been fairly successful with maintaining my health. I've become a homeowner. And soon... a father.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I guess what I'm saying is at 25, I thought I was going to live to see another 25 years worth of days exactly like those around my 25th birthday.... but the next 25 years aren't going to be like the past 30. They're going to be different. Different isn't better, nor worse. It's just what's next.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">In that same Column from 2013 I debuted my first Second-A-Day-For-A-Year video - My 24th Year. In the following 4 years I added to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw" target="_blank">the continuous story of my mid-to-late 20s</a>. There's not a "My 29th Year" Second-A-Day video attached to this Column or in that playlist. There will be one soon, but there won't be a "My 30th Year". I'm moving to something better.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">My numbering was off by one the whole time anyway. This wasn't my 29th year, it was my 30th. When you turn an age, that's the number of years you've already lived. You weren't born at -1. Idiot.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Meh. I'm not infallible. I'm just old.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: Tinos; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RlEruztKIsA/W2Oj2M11A_I/AAAAAAADIx8/6tW7QKpnNCgFB-Y3SlomKNeSCKMZX2cpQCKgBGAs/s1600/download_20180802_060407.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="1152" height="640" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RlEruztKIsA/W2Oj2M11A_I/AAAAAAADIx8/6tW7QKpnNCgFB-Y3SlomKNeSCKMZX2cpQCKgBGAs/s640/download_20180802_060407.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Best, Most Succinct Self-Realizations I've Ever Had</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
