# Philosophy of Philosophical Thinking

I've been living in a philosophical realm too much lately. It's not something I'm *outright* disappointed by, but it feels good to do concrete things. It's hard to be productive when you've spent 10 of the past 16 hours turning through concepts over and over. I don't remember exactly which of the books I've read recently said this - but "planning is a form of procrastination." While not all of my thinking lately can be appropriately categorized as *"planning"*, I think the sentiment holds true for all of it. Considering abstractly that which **could** be made into reality is a lazy, procrastabatory/* act. This has been my reality, both at home and at work.

/* Procrastabatory - adj. - wastes time and feels good.

This Column is going to be a reflection of these topics about which I've been stuck on. [These are a few of my incredible thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRlIDIu2qpg)
