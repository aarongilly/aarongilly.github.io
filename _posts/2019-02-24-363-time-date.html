<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: This Column was Meant to be about Many Topics</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I have been thinking some about how stupid our conventions are for times and dates. I wonder if I could come up with something better. This Column is basically a thought experiment, as it progresses.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The year is (roughly) 365 and 1/4 days long. We break that up into 52 weeks, each 7 days long.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">52 x 7 = 364</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">So inherently we've got a flaw there.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The prime factorization of 365 is 73 x 5. So we COULD do 73 weeks, each 5 days long. Of course, then our structure for "weekday" and "weekend" would be all messed up. People would either have to work 4 days a week <i>(8.6% more than a standard work week now)</i> or 3 days a week <i>(11.4% less)</i>. Also any sort of social structure that's set up to operate "every other day" would have a weird time dealing with weekends.</span><br /><b><br /></b><b>BUT!</b>&nbsp;A year isn't 5 x 73 days long, either. It's more like 5 x 73 + 0.2422 days long.<br /><br />So, no set number of days would make a year whole without having to fudge around with concepts like "Leap Years". So maybe we could just embrace that concept, and give ourselves a dedicated <i>weird</i>&nbsp;"Leap" portion of the year each year, to allow ourselves to have something that makes more sense for the rest of the year.<br /><br /><u><b>Date proposal:</b></u><br /><ul><li>6 days a week</li><li>5 weeks a month</li><li>12 months a year&nbsp;</li><li>The remaining 5.2422 days aren't in a month - they are called "Leap week", which fluctuates between 5 and 6 days every 4-ish years and occurs at the end of the yearly cycle</li></ul><br />This keeps our day-to-day in the realm of base 12, which we use for time. It also keeps us in the realm of our currently-existing time-frames. Weeks and months would be roughly the same length they already are. Benefits are - now each month begins on a Monday, it's possible to do "every other day" or "every 3rd day"-type recurring events and maintain days of the week. It makes date math much easier, provided you're not going over Leap week at the end of the year.<br /><br />In terms of <i>time</i>... I have fewer complaints. See the Top 5 for a few of them. But if I could change something, wouldn't it be nice if we just kept base 24? 24 hours a day, 24 minutes an hour 24 seconds a minute? Each second would be equal to 6 1/4 seconds in our current timing scheme. You could then enact thirds, which would be about 1/4 of our regular seconds.<br /><br />Fun fact, if you didn't already know "Seconds" are named "seconds" because they are the second division of the hour by 60. Hence me mentioning thirds above.<br /><br />Alright, rather than talk about anything else with this - here's a picture to go out on of the calendar I made that fixes all the world's problems:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q_VtjPkTAp4/XHL-aoWu0JI/AAAAAAADro0/Coqc14m5SYMoJVHafmMNAjNBUSP1R6yfgCLcBGAs/s1600/Capture.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="731" data-original-width="768" height="608" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-q_VtjPkTAp4/XHL-aoWu0JI/AAAAAAADro0/Coqc14m5SYMoJVHafmMNAjNBUSP1R6yfgCLcBGAs/s640/Capture.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Time and Date Conventions I Wish We Could Change</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. Each day of the week &amp; each month of the year should start with a different, unique letter.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. AM and PM should die, all time should be military time. 6AM and 6PM have nothing in common.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. Dates &amp; times should be written in a standard format; preferably something that starts general then gets specific - e.g. right now = "2019.02.24|09:51"<br class="kix-line-break" />2. We should redo the structure of the year. 52 weeks, 12 months, each month has between 28 and 31 days in it. Each week is 7 days. Each day is made of 24 hours, each of which is divided into 60 seconds. Our date &amp; time structure is reminiscent of Harry Potter money.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Daylight saving time shouldn't exist</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"A duck with glasses represents a smart duck - a.k.a. a brain"</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Nick, posturing a solution to the problem of his inability to draw brains as well as he can draw ducks -</span></div>
