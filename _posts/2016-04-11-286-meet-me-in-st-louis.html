<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: What's Left to Write? (this is a very similar pun to the one I made <a href="http://www.aarongilly.com/2016/02/282-monitor-videogames.html">4 Columns ago</a>, sorry)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm writing this from a hotel in St. Louis. Melissa and I are here for the weekend for the 2016 Regional American Music Therapy Conference and as an excuse to sit around all day an avoid responsibilities (fun game: guess which one of us is here for what!). We plan on seeing the sites (sights?), enjoying nice meals, and, in celebration of the start of our re-watch of Parks and Recreation: treating yo self.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F0tDUv4-HO0/Vwgv2U-4UfI/AAAAAAACJvo/pmIikeyFd7MrY8GgIwT9FklahHaV7EhVA/s1600/%2523286%2B-%2BTreat%2BYo%2BSelf.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F0tDUv4-HO0/Vwgv2U-4UfI/AAAAAAACJvo/pmIikeyFd7MrY8GgIwT9FklahHaV7EhVA/s640/%2523286%2B-%2BTreat%2BYo%2BSelf.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">That introductory paragraph was the <i>only</i>&nbsp;thing I wrote in St. Louis. I'm already back home. In the time it took you to look at that picture and move onto this sentence, I went to the St. Louis Museum, St. Louis Zoo, the mall, fell asleep, and drove 4 hours back home. I'm quick.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>One of the main things I wanted to write about today was my 12 New Year's Resolutions (which, you may remember, are what I'm doing instead of 30 Day Challenges for this year).<br /><br />By the end of the year - I want to...<br /><b><br /></b><b>Weigh 240</b>&nbsp;- this is still very possible, but despite my honest efforts I have changed my weight from 226 to 227. That's 100% within my daily weight fluctuation. So. No change.<br /><br /><b>Bench 240 </b>- I've gone from ~200 to 205. Sadly, this is still 20 pounds down from a couple years back. I'm behind.<br /><br /><b>Squat 315</b>&nbsp;- I've gone from ~240 to ~260... maybe more if I had a spotter/confidence.<br /><br /><b>Deadlift 345</b>&nbsp;- I've gone from 280ish to 315... which technically is what I deadlift a few months back. This time I didn't have the benefit of a belt.<br /><br /><b>Incorporate 3 Miles Runs into My Workout Routine</b>&nbsp;- not even close. Zero improvement.<br /><br /><b>Macro Ratio: Fats &amp; Protein Up, Carbs Down</b>&nbsp;- FINALLY SUCCESS. I've had ~1% change in the appropriate direction for each.<br /><br /><b>Track 80%</b>&nbsp;- another success. I'm at 90% for the year.<br /><br /><b>Booze, Soda, and Energy Drinks Only Once per Month&nbsp;</b>- other than the inclusion of "vacations", this goal is still going very well. St. Louis was a mini vacation.<br /><br /><b>Slowly Build Savings </b>- meh. Minor success. Vacations have and will continue to eat into that.<br /><br /><b>Go Out of the Contiguous 48 States</b>&nbsp;- I think Melissa and I are likely to go on a cruise with a stop in the Bahamas. That counts.<br /><br /><b>Read 12 Books</b>&nbsp;- I'm 2 1/2 books down 4 1/2 months into the year. Not on track.<br /><br /><b>Screen Time Trending Toward One Hour</b>&nbsp;- while my average screen time is down 40 minutes/day... it's got another 100 minutes to go.<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Comedic Performances by Traditionally Serious Actors</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. Honestly, I only had four in mind. Google tells me I should probably put Jeff Bridges in "The Big Lebowski", but honestly "The Dude" wasn't really what made me laugh the hardest in that movie. Maybe John Goodman? But he's done a fair amount of comedy. Anyway, let's move on.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Tom Cruise in "Tropic Thunder"<br class="kix-line-break" />3. John Cena in "Trainwreck"<br class="kix-line-break" />2. Jason Statham in "Spy"<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Michael Shannon in "The Night Before" - this was my inspiration to do this Top 5, it was so fantastic</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Don't trust the lid."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- I don't remember who told me this... but it's great advice -</span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">If you noticed my new footer, I'm impressed.</div>
