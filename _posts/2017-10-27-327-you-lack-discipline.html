<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Discipline Beats Motivation</span><br /><br />Lately I have had trouble doing new Aaron things.<br /><br />The ideas haven't gone. It's the follow through. I sought to remedy this situation by nixing passive entertainment from my life in October. That worked until it didn't.&nbsp;<i><span style="color: #999999;">I set goals, do a great job with them at first, but after a bit I'm back to baseline Aaron. The goal is present, but the change in behavior is not.</span></i><br /><br />Comfort is the problem.<br />Control is the answer.<br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Captain America.</span><br /><br />...or maybe that's just what I think.<br /><br />I wonder if it I could play a Clair De Lune on the piano in a month?<br />I wonder what it would be like to stop drinking caffeine &amp; alcohol entirely?<br />I wonder what it's like to eat an IIFYM diet?<br />I wonder if I could make my own shirt from a sheet of fabric?<br />I wonder if I could design and construct my own pergola?<br />I wonder what I should do to continue my education?<br />I wonder if I could have an Android app in the Play Store before the end of the year?<br />I wonder what it would be like if I used lotion on one half of my body every day for a few months, would it be noticeably different from the other after I stop?<br /><br />These thoughts have felt like strictly hypothetical impossibilities. "Ah man I wish I could just do this" when there's literally no reason I couldn't other than it would mean I'd have to change behavior. I'd have to follow through. I'm throwing the ball at the rim right now.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I used to have so much less to do, and I feel like I got more done. It's most likely that's the benefit afforded to you by the distance between the present and the past.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><br />Or maybe I've been too hard on myself.<br /><br />I've had basically the same set of goals for the longest time... and maybe the problem lately is that I've achieved most of them. Or I've achieved them to a level that I'm not willing to surpass. I could murder myself in the gym and get to my goal strength... but that wouldn't be worth it. As someone with an MBA would say: The ROI isn't there, opportunity costs are high. Invest elsewhere.<br /><br />Maybe it's time to change my goals. Think bigger. Think different. Or maybe just think less. Maybe I should just live a non-goal-oriented life for a while.<br /><br />Nah, doubt that.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The things that are right and true when you're thinking with your best, most well-rested brain are also right and true on the days where you're not. I feel like that's important to know... but I thought of it when I was grooving on a caffeine buzz, so it won't be true when I'm bummed out or sleepy or hungry.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'll just have to keep seeing the glass half full - also split in half vertically:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eYZQHN10tSU/We1HFqwrKwI/AAAAAAACzSM/BRUMjJJTJk0TMuIL2Jid_SG43nDAgiV5wCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20171022_091930.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eYZQHN10tSU/We1HFqwrKwI/AAAAAAACzSM/BRUMjJJTJk0TMuIL2Jid_SG43nDAgiV5wCKgBGAs/s640/IMG_20171022_091930.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Underrated Comedy Movies</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
