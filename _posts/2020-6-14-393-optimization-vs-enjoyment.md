# Balancing Optimized Results and Enjoying the Process
I've come to see a flaw in one of my core philosophies. The idea, which I've written about on here before, is that <span style="color: red">**standardized routines enable satisfactory results while freeing the mind to think about bigger and better things**</span>. The flaw I've come to realize with a blind application of this approach is that it can kill the fun of the journey.

## Coffee Example 
I make coffee at the same time every day, following the exact same set of steps. My routine produces the right amount of coffee with the right level of strength, in a minimal amount of time, and leaves me with clean counter. I can do this set of 6 steps in my sleep. Literally. I do it first thing in the morning. I've made coffee, gone back to sleep, and not remembered doing it.

The idea of here is that making coffee is now a solved problem. I no longer have to think, and therefore I'm free to consider life's bigger problems. I can think about what I want to accomplish today. I can think about how to solve a problem that's been dogging me. I can think about whatever I want, and still produce the black magical elixir of happiness. It's multichannel multitasking at its finest.

Here's the rub: because I follow this routine, the act of *making coffee* no longer provides me any level of satisfaction. It's not inherently pleasing. I don't stop and smell the beans. I have freed my mind to think about anything, and as a result I have been "freed" to use my coffee making routine as a time to continue to be anxious about this or worry about that. 

## Bath Example
I am the parent that handles bathtime around this house. It used to be a big ordeal. I'd regularly request assistance. I'd regularly have to stop in order to fetch forgotten items or go back and re-do steps. I'd have to ask my 1 year old to change positions repeatedly. Through a series of dedicated and intentional process improvements I've got a bathtime routine that I can accomplish in no more than 5 minutes, producing a satisfactorily clean child in the process.

Now that I've run out of inefficiencies to smooth out, bathtime has turned into a chore. It's become a thing that I have to do, rather than a thing I enjoyed doing. My child gets to enjoy short tub times, but that's not the point.

## In Summary

This is not an *abandon all hope, ye who enter here* situation. It's not something where the bathwater needs to go, regardless of where the baby is located. Optimization is a good and worthwhile endeavor; but it shouldn't be blindly pursued. A well-optimized life isn't the be-all and end-all goal at the end of the day. The solution is *balance*, above all else. That is and always has been my #2 Life Pro Tip[^1].

Or, another way of putting it:

> The point of life isn't to optimize as many things as possible, it's to *enjoy* as many things as possible.

# Other Thoughts  
## Ending Quarantine
Quarantine seems like it's coming to a close. I don't think I utilized my time poorly at all, aside from possibly getting a little too good at Super Smash Bros. I revamped my site. I read a bunch of books. I spent a lot of evening with my wife and son. I got back into digital drawing. I practiced guitar. I learned some neat coding stuff. I wrote some notes. I wrote some posts. I worked out. I made a bunch of podcasts. I went on walks with the family. I taught myself CAD and built a standing desk.

It's funny to think now that we went out and bought a puzzle right before all this started so "we'd have something to do during quarantine". We would never have guessed I'd be writing about slowly coming out of it 3 1/2 months later - into a new world full of expanded personal space bubbles and people drawing smiles on their masks to make things seem less cold and unfriendly.

## CotW
My [Creation of the Week]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/creations/) project is humming along. The page itself could use some TLC, but I'm happy to have established a public repository for creative output. I can't wait to see it in a year, or five.
