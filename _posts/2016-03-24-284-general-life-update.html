<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: lightly flavored carbonated water â‰  soda</span><br /><br />HI!<br /><br />I don't write as much any more. That's just the way things are, and the way they will likely continue to be. It's my official/unofficial policy not to talk about wishing I wrote more. I don't wish that. I write exactly as much as I wish I wrote. See the Top 5 for reasons Columns have dropped down to once every few weeks.<br /><br />Side benefit of less frequent posts: my quotes are of a higher quality.<br /><br />Have you heard of the Amazon Echo? It's a discrete little cylinder, slightly bigger than an energy drink can, but smaller than a two liter bottle. It's a consumer electronic device without a screen. How novel! People who have them love them, apparently. The various tech-related podcasts I listen to talk about it every week. I met a dude who owned one. He reflected the common sentiment. Why isn't there an Apple version? Why isn't there a Google cylinder?<br /><br />I'm watching KU's Sweet 16 game. We are about to win over Maryland. By the time I post again, the tournament will likely be over. I hope we win.<br /><br />Batman V Superman is officially out. I could be watching that right now instead of writing this, but I don't care enough to try to fight opening-night crowds. Maybe tomorrow. Early reviews seem to point to a common set of highlights and lowlights. Common review score: "meh/10". It looks like Civil War basically has to just show up to play to be better.<br /><br />I'm good. I'm still pumped about the routine. I'm genuinely enjoying my 9-5 every weekday. I come home to a beautiful woman whom I adore. I have a pair of cats that do stupid stuff and make me laugh. Marvel movies are on the horizon &amp; the second season of Daredevil delivered. My back isn't really bothering me, despite taking almost no anti-inflammatories. I'm getting a bit stronger each time I go to the gym. My work basketball team is doing really well. I'm arguably playing better than ever before. I'm eating better and sleeping better. Really I've been riding a streak of generally good days for quite a while. Like everyone, I'll let a bad day in - but they they can't keep me down.<br /><br />My goal for this post was to say a bunch of good things and make you, the reader, simultaneously bored and disdainful.<br /><br />Naw. Not really. I don't say how good things are because that's typically boring to hear, but it needs to be said from time to time. I appreciate this life I've got.<br /><br />Looking through my recent photos, there's not much to post that isn't already on my Instagrams. So I decided to dig into my "For the Column" folder to find an image representative of this Column. I couldn't decide between these two:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EjPAiT9gt_M/VvTBU3trltI/AAAAAAACIZs/pljHPfpYw6MBphkcZ8AVWgrkUrkv8GCWQ/s1600/Fabulous.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EjPAiT9gt_M/VvTBU3trltI/AAAAAAACIZs/pljHPfpYw6MBphkcZ8AVWgrkUrkv8GCWQ/s1600/Fabulous.jpg" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IHySQqwBpSw/VvTBUg22Y6I/AAAAAAACIZo/ImFU3F9KXQQseAxAaiAbJTxQ9lwnqx6kQ/s1600/hatersgunnahate.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IHySQqwBpSw/VvTBUg22Y6I/AAAAAAACIZo/ImFU3F9KXQQseAxAaiAbJTxQ9lwnqx6kQ/s1600/hatersgunnahate.gif" /></a></div><br />Which one should have won?<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Reasons I'm Writing Fewer Columns</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. I've seen friends more. It's fun &amp; good.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Hitman 2016 came out. It's fun &amp; good.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. I'm too busy making up excuses.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. Any given day I only have maybe an couple hour outside of work, working out/playing a social after work sports league game, cooking, cleaning, and sleeping. That's less fun &amp; good, but it's as good as it realistically could be.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. I find work more intellectually stimulating. It's fun &amp; good.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quotes:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"How did you know I fart when I get nervous?"</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Jon -</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"><br /></span><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Wanna be fitness, but don't wanna do fitness."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"></span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- BroScienceLife -</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"><br /></span><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"After so many years playing basketball, you get to a point where you're just telling at yourself constantly."</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;"></span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- Chuck, who I believe will continue show up down here more and more -</span></div>
