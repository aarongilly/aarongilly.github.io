<div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Don't say cheese, just smile.</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: 700;">Life is Good.</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">This is the kind of stuff I think about.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">What is "smart"? What makes somebody smart? Is it just... knowing a lot of things? Is somebody <i>smart </i>just because they do really well in bar trivia? Are you smart because you've read so many books? Is she smart because she's so well-traveled? Is he smart because he's experienced a lot of things?</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I don't think "smart" is definable in a global scope. It's sort of like "healthy". It doesn't <i>mean</i>&nbsp;anything, really. Healthy is what you define it to be. If you die of a heart attack at 35, but that was your plan all along - does that make you "unhealthy"? Planning to die at 35 certainly makes you not <i>smart</i>... so what does? Maybe "smartness" is something you just know when you see it, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I'm not "smart" because I pulled that sweet Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart reference. I had to Google 'who said that thing about "I know it when I see it"'... but just because I had to <i>Google </i>it - does that take away that I said it? Is smartness just having the ability to produce results?</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">A smart person would probably know.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">A smarter person would probably say "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItV8utelYlc">don't think about it</a>".</div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Along a similar vein - have you ever considered the difference between <i>actually </i>learning something vs just "learning the sequence of words that explains the thing"? I think my college education was very much centered around "learning a sequence of maths that does a thing" and NOT about the real-world applications that would invoke those maths.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I can <i>read</i>&nbsp;about how to accomplish X or Y in Java on Android - but until I apply X or Y to solve a real-world problem, it's somewhat meaningless. Breaking code into functions seemed like a completely meaningless set of steps to take when I could just write that same code directly into the main body of whatever. Today the concept of <i>not</i>&nbsp;containerizing code just seems... brutish and messy.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">And now for something completely different.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best videogames I've ever played. I watched my brother-in-law play some of it over the weekend and I was reminded just how delightful the experience was.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">And now for something <i>else</i>&nbsp;completely different.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">I want to expand upon <a href="http://www.aarongilly.com/2016/06/291-crackers-update-clarity-chromeos.html">something I wrote about almost two years ago</a>...</span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><i>I feel like many of the major problems people have in their lives that they've struggled to control have well-known, simple, yet extremely unsexy solutions.</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">Weight management, financial management, how to wake up feeling rested, how to stay on top of tasks - these are solved problems. <b>Not </b>implementing the tried-and-true solutions to problems you're having is a matter of lack of discipline.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">&nbsp;I think that part of the problem is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">Hedonic Treadmill</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">and a tendency for each of us to return to the status quo in a more general sense. You do a thing. It makes you happy for a while, until it doesn't. Then you stop doing the thing even though you know it's good for you.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">I think that it's hard to change behaviors and attitudes without changing environments. Once you've established a pattern of behavior in a given place, that's just sort of how you are there. I go to my parents house and I'm instantly high school Aaron again.</span><br /><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">I'd like to sit down high school Aaron and show him the Top 10 from below... although I don't think it would have much effect.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">&nbsp;I'm not saying that I have these problems solved, I saying I can describe how one&nbsp;</span><i style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">would</i><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;">&nbsp;solve them.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><i><br /></i></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><i><b>T</b></i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><i><b>hat's</b> </i>the difference between learning the sequence of English words that explain a thing versus actually learning the thing.</span><br /><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms, sans-serif;">Alright that's all I had, I've gotta go have a good evening.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EoEjL1E2iiY/WoJqKf-Y8yI/AAAAAAAC5lY/dmo5D6wEsSYuiAHvTrhd8cIUKnzrbWKWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Happy%2BRun%2BOut.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="185" data-original-width="275" height="269" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EoEjL1E2iiY/WoJqKf-Y8yI/AAAAAAAC5lY/dmo5D6wEsSYuiAHvTrhd8cIUKnzrbWKWQCLcBGAs/s400/Happy%2BRun%2BOut.gif" width="400" /></a></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 10: Simple Solutions to Life's Big Problems</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">10. If you're having trouble with money, make a budget. There's a billion tools and techniques. They all achieve the same thing. Follow the budget.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">For more money stuff, see&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Index_Card">this notecard</a><span style="color: red;">.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">9. Talk to people around you. Talk about your problems. Talk about their problems. Talk about the weather. If you're unhappy, talk to a therapist.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">8. Regardless of your religion, at least 6 or 7 of Christianity's 10 Commandments are no-brainers. Do those things. I'm sure there's some super obvious stuff included in other religions that I'm not aware of</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">7. If you have tasks, write them down someplace you'll see them. If you have an appointment, put it in a calendar. If your tasks need to be done by a certain time, put them in that calendar, too. If you don't have a calendar, y</span><span style="color: red;">our phone is a more than capable of covering this.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">6. Have a place for everything, and put everything in its place.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. If you're drinking something that's not water, have a reason.&nbsp;<span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">Drink&nbsp;</span>water&nbsp;almost exclusively.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Don't smoke. If you're a smoker and you want to stop. Don't buy cigarettes. I contend that if you're addicted to thing, <i>having </i>the thing is going to prevent you from getting over that addiction. If you're a smoker, why? Seriously why? That's maybe a different topic, but how could you possibly have gotten yourself into that situation? How D.A.R.E. you.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">3. Lift weights, do cardio, and stretch. There's a million exercise routines, but the basics cover basically everything. If you are going to become a bodybuilder, physique model, or high-level athlete then you'll know what else you need to do. If you're not those things, then you don't need to do much else.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. Sleep consistent hours. Don't hit snooze. Avoid screens for an hour before bed, and definitely while <i>in </i>bed.<br class="kix-line-break" />1.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">Delete Facebook.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">Hit the gym.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">Lawyer up.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"What? What is that thing?
