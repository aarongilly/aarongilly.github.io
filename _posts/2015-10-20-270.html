<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: GET ON MY LEVEL</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">The initial reviews for the Nexus 6P are coming back. I'm buying into the </span><b>#HYPE</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">. <a href="http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/10/featured-review-google-nexus-6p-2015.html">Initial</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/19/nexus-6p-review-this-is-the-android-device-that-youve-been-waiting-for/#.c3ufe2:6X7g">Reviews</a>. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/nexus-5x-and-nexus-6p-review-the-true-flagships-of-the-android-ecosystem/">Are</a>. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/10/19/nexus-6p-review/">All</a>. <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/19/nexus-6p-review-preview-so-far-its-everything-id-hoped/">Positive</a>. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review">Seriously</a>. I am <u>excited</u> for this phone in a way I haven't been since the Galaxy Nexus four years ago... it looks to be a phenomenal showing for Android - a true flagship to stand opposite the iPhone. My Nexus 6P and my wife's iPhone 6S Plus are a perfectly matched duo - I like that. It's a nice symmetry for the life of our tech.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Speaking of </span><b>#HYPE</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span> <br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGbxmsDFVnE" width="800"></iframe><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm not the world's biggest Star Wars fan. Not that I'm not a fan - I actually quite like Star Wars... it's just that I've only ever seen the original trilogy once for certain - and that was about a month ago. I'd seen parts and pieces of it in the past, but I hadn't "officially" watched them all the way through, in order. Thus I cannot properly say that I have the same level of </span><b>#HYPE</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> as other, better fans... but I'm still quite excited.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I CAN say that I am <strike>probably</strike> the biggest Marvel Cinematic Universe fan that I know. When Age of Ultron came out on bluray I started a massive re-watch of the series. Thank you to my wife, who's put up with me watching Marvel movies every other night for the past couple weeks. I'll complete the re-watch probably by week's end. Then I'll pick up Ant-Man for the holidays, re-watch it by itself... then bunker up and wait for Captain America: Civil War in May. I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the </span><b>#HYPE</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. tonight. <b>#HYPE</b>.<br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm excited about work things, but I make it a policy not to talk about work things online. It's partially why I am not active on LinkedIn. Another reason I'm not active on LinkedIn is because their service spammed my email with dozens of emails a week until I got around to unsubscribing from the feeds they thought should be defaults for some reason. Regardless, </span><b>#HYPE</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Fantasy Football is a wonderful way to socialize. Also, it's a wonderful way to learn about football if you otherwise wouldn't care about the sport... or so I'm told by a friend that applies to who is definitely not me. No hype here. Just a footnote.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's the picture to go out on - my father-in-law flying in to see us:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FyQQz1ys4ps/ViaIEDJPH0I/AAAAAAAB_pk/J9FhsKz42mU/s1600/IMG_20151017_143146.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="474" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FyQQz1ys4ps/ViaIEDJPH0I/AAAAAAAB_pk/J9FhsKz42mU/s640/IMG_20151017_143146.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Things I'm Less #HYPEd about</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. It's election season... sorta. All I'll hear about for the next however many months is politics.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. If not politics - I'll hear holiday-related music. I look forward to some parts of the holidays, but the constant renditions of "Oh Silent Night" grow tiresome.<br class="kix-line-break" />3.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: red;">Winter is coming. It's gunna be cold out again.</span><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;"><br class="kix-line-break" />2. It's flu season.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. I'm writing this at the DMV. I took a day of vacation to come sit in a chair at the DMV. At least they have table for my Chromebook.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span> <br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Now serving phone number: 4878"</span> <br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- The intercom just now...
