<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Google's Indexing the Internet, Alphabetically</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'm embarrassed by that motto.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Trebuchet is my favorite font. Presuming your browser didn't hijack my typeface, you should be reading this in Trebuchet. Isn't it great?</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I wrote a whole post about my height and relationship to basketball. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control, I have lost that post. Literally, I lost the USB drive that I had the post on. My current theory is that it was on Oceanic Flight 815.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><b><i>LOST</i></b><br /><b><i><br /></i></b>A few days back, I was shocked to read that Google's founders were creating a <i>new</i>&nbsp;company, under which Google would fall. The new company:&nbsp;Alphabet. I thought it was going to be huge news. Then, I figured out it really doesn't change anything. THEN, I realized it's changing <i>everything</i>... eventually. This move is not immediately interesting, but could eventually be a very large headline in a "History of Consumer Technology" book.<br /><br />Google Hangouts is perhaps finally getting the love &amp; attention it has deserved from day one. <a href="http://hangouts.google.com/">This link</a> is what I'm referring to.<br /><br />Android "M" now has an official name and version number. The name: "Marshmallow"... which was fairly well expected. The version number: 6.0. This was not expected for what appeared to be a fairly small release. Seriously, there's not too much there from what I can see (which is admittedly very little, from this chair). See the Top 5 for the new features of Android Marshmallow. Spoiler alert - I'm skeptical/underwhelmed.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cRF0ZFIj3vs/VdPlSA9JV8I/AAAAAAAB62w/buVISUqbr3k/s1600/%2523256%2B-%2BAndroid%2BMarshmallow.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cRF0ZFIj3vs/VdPlSA9JV8I/AAAAAAAB62w/buVISUqbr3k/s640/%2523256%2B-%2BAndroid%2BMarshmallow.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />I added a new feature to the Life Tracker. First one in quite some time. Basically, now it gets a weather <i>forecast</i>&nbsp;for the upcoming day. It used to only get the weather <i>history</i>&nbsp;for the previous day. This new change will give me a glimpse at the upcoming weather for the day &amp; will prevent holes in the data when OpenWeatherMap's API honks up.<br /><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Android Marshmallow Features</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5. Android Pay - because Google Wallet has been a terrible flop in the real world, Google is reworking the system and rebranding under the Android moniker. Worked for Android TV, didn't it? (didn't it?... <i>didn't it?!</i>)<br class="kix-line-break" />4. Fingerprints - a good payment system needs a way to authenticate your payments that isn't obtrusive to the user. Fingerprints are not good ways to authenticate... but I am 100% sure that despite that well-founded opinion I am going to use mine this way anyways.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. App Permissions - the new permissions system pops up only when the app <i>needs</i>&nbsp;them. This is the way it should have been all along.<br class="kix-line-break" />2. USB-C. Android phones are moving to the USB Type C (USB-C) standard. NOTE THIS IS THE FIRST THING ON THIS LIST THAT ISN'T JUST AN iOS FEATURE PARITY UPGRADE... and even <i>this</i> could be argued to be a move closer to the iPhone. We're getting a reversible connector.&nbsp;<br class="kix-line-break" />1. Now on Tap - supposedly this is "huge". It's basically a way to run Google search magic on whatever's on your screen. It's a vaguely defined feature that will probably be underwhelming at first but get better over time. This is the only truly <i>new</i>&nbsp;thing I really remember from the Google I/O announcement.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"WOW YOU'RE TALL! You must <i>looove</i>&nbsp;basketball!"</span><br /><span style="color: lime; font-style: italic;">- This was the quote from the Column about my height and basketball that I lost. For the record, it's been nearly 5 whole hours since someone asked if I play basketball -</span></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">If you noticed my new footer, I'm impressed.</div>
