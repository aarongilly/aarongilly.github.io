# Motto: Like Before, but More

It's October. That means a few things - Halloween is coming, it's getting colder, and my second second-a-day video is already 16% done.

I was writing in my [Moleskine](http://images.wisegeek.com/raised-skin-mole.jpg) during lunch on Tuesday (the 1st), when I realized I wanted to try something big for October. A post came up the other day on [r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness) about what really really tall weightlifters can and cannot do well. I learned a few things from reading that (for example, 6'2" is considered really really tall for some people). From that post, I moved on to articles aimed at weightlifting for the "vertically gifted". I decided that, with my diet, I hadn't ever given my body much of a chance. 

Here's what I wrote -

So that's my plan. The October Project: get Large. 

...and because I'm Life Tracking, I'll be able to see objectively how well I adhered to the guidelines.

**Day 0: 223 lbs**

**Day 1 -**

- Calories - 3013
- Fats - 85
- Carbs - 454
- Protein - 183

**Day 2 -**

- Calories - 4088
- Fats - 147
- Carbs - 494
- Protein - 230

That brings us through today. Still haven't eaten out. Still haven't had caffeine. That's pretty cool.

There's a Google Engineer by the name of Matt Cutts who gave an excellent TED talk that I saw a long time ago. It's 3:27 long. If you have that kind of time, I suggest you watch this:

![this is a link now. Click me I guess.](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days?language=en)

The TL;DW of it is this: Try something you've always wanted to try for 30 days. That's long enough to evaluate how you like it, long enough establish habit, but short enough to be doable. When I stumbled across this video I considered trying it, but decided to forego in lieu of a different project: the first iteration of the Demetri List (the list of 35 things a good person does every week (which was later adapted to the list of 25 things I aim to do every day in the Life Tracker)).

The October Project is me testing out the "try something new for 30 days" waters.

In other news, I was correct about GoPro announcing a new model, making my camera officially "old". It took less than a day before I decided to start throwing it around:
