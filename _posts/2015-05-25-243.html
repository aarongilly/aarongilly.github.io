<div><span style="color: #ff9900; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Motto: I think Parcheesi is a cheap, unpleasant, and blatantly inauthentic game</span></div><br /><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">I am writing this on our porch. We really like our place. Even after the "<i>newness"</i>&nbsp;has worn off we've still comment about our deep affection for our home every day, and that's a really nice feeling.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The Column here I'd like to take in a slightly new direction. I'd rather produce shorter, more well-edited posts than I have been writing. This will be the first of that not-too-drastic change in direction.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">This week is Google I/O. I/O is Google's annual developer conference that I've written about <a href="http://aarongilly.blogspot.com/search?q=Google+I%2FO">many, many times</a>. Rather than tell you my predictions based off other people's speculation, I'm just going to tell you what I <i>hope</i>&nbsp;will happen.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I hope Google announces a Nexus device that doesn't turn out to be a massive flop. I hope they announce new features and updates to existing ones that provide a clear direction for 2015. Last year was a bit of a down year. I hope not to look back on I/O 2015 and be disappointed.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">I started to write a post a few days back that didn't talk about Google, Android, Life Tracking, Marvel, or the word "I". I didn't give you that. Instead you got this.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Yesterday Melissa and I watched one of our mutual friends and coworkers from 5 years ago get married. Congratulations to Steve and Kaitie and thanks for the great night.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Here's the picture to go out on - I took it at our pool earlier today:</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aCGzjUWFizI/VWPJyuasmwI/AAAAAAABzLQ/wwLeM4wkmQQ/s1600/IMG_20150525_170110.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="472" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aCGzjUWFizI/VWPJyuasmwI/AAAAAAABzLQ/wwLeM4wkmQQ/s640/IMG_20150525_170110.jpg" width="640" /></a></div></div><br /><div><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Potential Futures for "The Column"</span></div><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;">5. Leaving Blogger for an actual website.<br class="kix-line-break" />4. What makes up the Column now may be broken out into different sections. Each of the sections will be treated differently.<br class="kix-line-break" />3. "Feature" posts will become "living" posts. There will remain few in numbers, but will grow and change over time along with my thoughts about their topics.</span><span style="color: red; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br class="kix-line-break" />2. Like the Features, posts made specifically to share a self-produced piece of media will be&nbsp;curated.<br class="kix-line-break" />1. "The Column" will still very much be a thing. It will still contain a Motto, Top 5, and Quote.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Quote:</span><span style="color: #ff9900; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="color: lime; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Write it in your calendar.
