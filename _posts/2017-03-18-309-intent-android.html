<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Sentences that Begin and End with the Same Word are My Favorite Sentences.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Before this 30 Day Challenge I wouldn't really have understood the title I used for this Column.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Writing an Android App. That's the goal for March. Technically I accomplished that within the first day, within the first hour. Although "Hello World!" isn't much of an app. I've been working through <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803">Udacity's Android Basics nanodegree</a>. Well, the coursework that one would do to earn said nanodegree. I'm more interested in the knowledge than the resume boost.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Anyway it's been really good! It's aimed at people who have never coded before - so parts of it are definitely too easy... but that means I'm not getting left behind, like I did last time when I tried going straight into the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801">Android Developer nanodegree</a>. I'm now starting to get comfortable playing around in the IDE, making my phone do stuff I want it to do. It's my goal to write an app that's actually useful by month's end. Even if that use isn't my final goal. Ultimately, I'd like to create some form of the Life Tracker in Android. For now, I'll settle for something to supplement it.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pFda0jMfVlU/WM3GRXbhAGI/AAAAAAACnqA/l3SYNa673lwhpvoExhZblqCapdTwKLI0wCLcB/s1600/3770000421346278289-account_id%253D1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pFda0jMfVlU/WM3GRXbhAGI/AAAAAAACnqA/l3SYNa673lwhpvoExhZblqCapdTwKLI0wCLcB/s400/3770000421346278289-account_id%253D1.png" width="225" /></a></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Udacity is one of the coolest things on the internet, by the way. Free education for anyone who wants it. That's alright by me.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Completely shifting gears:</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">My first world problem for the day - I feel guilty. I feel guilty for shopping smart.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A while back, when I got my first job, I decided I was going to be high-and-mighty &amp; never, ever, shop at Walmart. Radical. I know. This was because I worked at Walmart for a summer. It sucked. I found it degrading, physically demanding, and low-paying. I was lucky, at least I had a light at then end of a tunnel. I was a college student getting a financially lucrative major, with a safety net in the form of my ever-supporting parents in case everything went to hell. Not everyone there was so lucky. I had more coworkers who had no future prospects than those that did. Walmart to me was exploiting its workers and raking in billions.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">So I started shopping at Target. Amazon.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Am I a moron? Are they any better, at all? No. There's a problem with these huge, buy-anything-you-want conglomerate stores. They are cheap. They are ever-present. They are a consistent source of the basic necessities and <i>they will not be undercut</i>.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I found myself in a bookstore today. I stumbled across the graphic novel "Fight Club 2". Chuck Palahniuk's follow-up to his smash hit "Fight Club". Now, I'm a walking cliche - so I liked Fight Club. I was interested in the sequel so I picked it up off the shelf. It's a graphic novel, so the book was wrapped shut. Not a big deal, I was going to buy it... until I saw the price. $30. I thought "wow that's a bit steep for a book", so naturally I pulled up the Amazon app on my phone. Amazon has it for $20. It will be at my house in 2 days.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I suck. Not 3 minutes prior I texted Melissa "I just found the coolest store. They sell everything we like." To thank them I've done them zero good. I've given them zero support. They are a specialty store, therefore they cannot afford to make fractions of a penny on things they sell. For that reason, I don't buy stuff from them. When their business dies, it will be the fault of me and people like me. I am the guilty middle class consumer.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I was going to write about budgeting and the benefits of not buying crap... but I'm out of time. BYE HAVE FUN SEE YOU LATER.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Website I Would Pick If I Could Only Go to Five for the Rest of My Life</span></div><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">5. Google Docs - creating new content.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">4. Facebook - for communication.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">3. Google's Search - even if you can't click on the links, you can learn a TON from reading link synopses... also you've got a calculator and the knowledge graph. Most of Google Maps is accessible without actually going there.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">2. YouTube - Arguably this should take the #1 spot. You'll never run out of entertainment content. You can learn anything you need to learn.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">1. Wikipedia - the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is essentially just Wikipedia. It's pretty much all you need to know. I put it as #1 because I like it; although YouTube is probably more useful for any in-depth learning. Udacity, the thing I opened this Column with, is built on top of YouTube.</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">Quote:</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot;, sans-serif;"><span style="color: lime; font-weight: bold;">"Love people, use things.
