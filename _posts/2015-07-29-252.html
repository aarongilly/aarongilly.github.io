<div style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #ff9900; font-weight: bold;">Motto: Healthy Living, No Gimmicks</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">GoPro makes one heck of a promotional video. Their newest "GoPro HERO4 Session" camera is tiny, but ultimately not compelling given the sacrifices it comes with. I'd say that's a shame, but thankfully I'm glad I don't want one.</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I like what I've been able to do with mine. There's no wrong way to use a GoPro:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ze8OiUAykwo" width="800"></iframe><br /><br />That was Tony, my dad, and I. We were shootsin'. Killing time, mostly, until I a new niece!<br /><br />This Saturday (August 1st) is my 27th birthday. I've come to accept that I'm old. SO OLD.<br /><br />I'm still doing 30 Day Challenges. <b>July</b> was to "Rewrite the Life Tracker". It was a complete success. I'm writing about August's challenge now because I don't want to muddy up my next update with 30 Day Challenge stuff. My next post will include my 3rd Second-A-Day video - "My 26th Year".<br /><br />August will be a busy month. Each day I will:<br /><ul><li>Run a mile</li><li>100 pushups</li><li>15 pullups</li><li>Drink only water &amp; coffee</li><li>Eat in, eat up</li><li>Bed at 10</li><li>Wake at 6</li><li>...and my stretch goal: Stretching (for 15 minutes)</li></ul><div>Summarizing all these things - August is going to be a "Month of Healthy Living Habits". They say the key to long-term success is to make little changes over time. I'm tired of that so I'm going to use the shotgun approach.</div><div><br /></div><div>I told you this was going to be short. Here's the picture to go out on:<br /><br />Melissa is back out of town for work again. So this picture is for me.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--0ekOLyu5Xk/VbcFXcgUuvI/AAAAAAAB41c/v7n4wAn0LeI/s1600/MBDNW.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--0ekOLyu5Xk/VbcFXcgUuvI/AAAAAAAB41c/v7n4wAn0LeI/s640/MBDNW.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><span id="goog_1046547055"></span></div><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Top 5: Things I Own, by Usage Time</span><br /><span style="color: red; font-weight: normal;">5.
